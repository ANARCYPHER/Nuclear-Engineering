`Massachusetts Institute of Technology`_
----------------------------------------

- **Guillaume Giudicelli** (@GiudGiud) is a PhD candidate in MIT's NSE Department working on implementing equivalence methods in OpenMOC. He also focused on OpenMOC optimization, implementing SIMD vectorization to make the most of CPU-based architectures.

- **Zhaoyuan Liu** (@johnnyliu27) is a PhD candidate in MIT's NSE Department working on modelling neutron scattering. He pioneered a new OpenMC_ tally based on neutron migration areas, which provides with an accurate transport correction for hydrogen-based systems.

- **Prof. Benoit Forget** is Associate Professor of Nuclear Science and Engineering at MIT. He leads research in a variety of reactor physics topics ranging from deterministic to stochastic methods and is a leading advisor for the OpenMOC development team.

- **Prof. Kord Smith** is the Korea Electric Power Company (KEPCO) Professor of the Practice of Nuclear Science and Engineering at MIT. He is Chief Scientist for the DOEâ€™s Office of Science, Center for Exascale Simulation of Advanced Reactors (CESAR), and a leading advisor for the OpenMOC development team.

`MIT Alumni`_
----------------------------------------

- **Travis Labossiere Hickman** (@tjlaboss) is a former Master student in MIT's NSE Department who worked on modeling of the TREAT reactor in OpenMOC, using multi-group cross sections from OpenMC_.

- **Dr. Colin Josey** (@cjosey) is a former PhD candidate in MIT's NSE Department who worked on high order integration schemes for the Bateman fuel depletion equations. He developed the Krylov solver for OpenMOC which allows the determination of higher eigenmodes.

- **Dr. Will Boyd** (@wbinventor) is a former PhD candidate in MIT's NSE Department who worked on statistical inference-based acceleration methods for Monte Carlo neutron transport simulations. He has been involved with OpenMOC from the start, with a focus on parallel algorithms for multi-core and GPU platforms.

- **Dr. Samuel Shaner** (@samuelshaner) is a former PhD candidate in the NSE Department who worked on time-dependent methods for deterministic and stochastic neutron transport simulations. As part of the initial development team, he worked on implementing coarse mesh finite difference acceleration.

- **Dr. Geoffrey Gunow** (@geogunow) is a former PhD candidate in MIT's NSE Department who worked on implementing a 3D MOC solver into OpenMOC using a linear source approximation. He joined the development team in June 2014 and co-authored SimpleMOC_, a mini-app that prototypes the performance of a 3D MOC solver.

- **Dr. Nathan Gibson** (@PrezNattyGibbs) has been a member of the OpenMOC development team since the fall of 2013 and was a Ph.D. candidate in the NSE Department at MIT. His research focused on using ultrafine energy discretization to account for self-shielding effects. He implemented these methods as well as legacy self-shielding methods using OpenMOC.

- **Dr. Lulu Li** (@lilulu) is a former PhD candidate in the NSE Department and was involved with OpenMOC with her fellow grad students from the start. She developed a physics-based multi-grid acceleration method called Low-Order Operator (LOO).

`Argonne National Laboratory`_
------------------------------

- **Dr. Tim Shuo** (@theshuo) was a predoctoral appointee with the Center for Exascale Simulation of Advanced Reactors (CESAR) at Argonne National Laboratory. He was working on performance profiling and scaling studies of OpenMOC.

- **Dr. Andrew Siegel** is a scientist in the Division of Mathematics and Computer Science at ANL and a fellow at the Computation Institute at the University of Chicago. He is the Director of the DOE's Office of Science, Center for Exascale Simulation of Advanced Reactors (CESAR), and was a leading advisor for the OpenMOC development team.

`Other institutions`_
---------------------

- **Dr Wenbin Wu** (@wuwenbin2006) developped non-uniform meshes and non-uniform CMFD during a postdoctoral appointment in CRPG.
