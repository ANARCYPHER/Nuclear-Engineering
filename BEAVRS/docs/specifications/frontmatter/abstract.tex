  \large\textbf ABSTRACT
\end{center}

Advances in parallel computing have made possible the development of
high-fidelity tools for the design and analysis of nuclear reactor cores, and
such tools require extensive verification and validation. This document
describes BEAVRS, a new multi-cycle full-core \ac{PWR} depletion benchmark based
on two operational cycles of a commercial nuclear power plant that provides a
detailed description of fuel assemblies, burnable absorbers, in-core fission
detectors, core loading patterns, and numerous in-vessel components. This
benchmark enables analysts to develop extremely detailed reactor core models
that can be used for testing and validation of coupled neutron transport,
thermal-hydraulics, and fuel isotopic depletion. The benchmark also provides
measured reactor data for \ac{HZP} physics tests, boron letdown curves, and
three-dimensional in-core flux maps from fifty-eight instrumented assemblies.
It should be noted however, that not all the necessary data are presented
in this document. It will be necessary for analysts to make appropriate
judgements and assumptions depending on methods employed.

This document and its associated data package is hosted
online at the MIT Computational Reactor Physics Group website
\url{http://crpg.mit.edu/}, where future revisions and refinements to the benchmark
specification will be made publicly available.
