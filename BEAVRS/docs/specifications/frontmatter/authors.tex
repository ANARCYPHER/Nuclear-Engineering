\section*{Acknowledgements}

We are extremely grateful for the detailed core specifications and measurement
data provided to us by the utility, which will remain un-named. Without their
generosity this benchmark would not be possible. We are also very grateful for
the work of the Advanced Simulation and Design Integration team at the Knolls
Atomic Power Laboratory, who contributed significantly to the development of
this document by reviewing, beta-testing, and making important suggestions from
the very beginning. We would also like to acknowledge the contributions of
Koroush Shirvan for his extensive reviewing and quality assurance work, as well
as Paul Romano for his help developing and debugging the OpenMC model of this
benchmark. Finally, we would like to thank Andrew Godfrey and Benjamin Collins
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, who provided significant feedback for the
second major version of this document.

Partial funding for the development of this benchmark was provided by the Center
for Exascale Simulation of Advanced Reactors, one of three exascale codesign
centers funded by the Department of Energyâ€™s Office of Advanced Scientific
Computing Research.
