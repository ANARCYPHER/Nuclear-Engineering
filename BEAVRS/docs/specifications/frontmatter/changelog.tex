\subsection*{10/16/13 - 1.1}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Added cycle 2 information: shuffling pattern, burnable absorbers, fresh

    \ref{num:fuel32_mat}, \ref{num:fuel34_mat} and \ref{num:assy_load_c2},
    Sections \ref{sec:ba_configs}, \ref{sec:corespec_enrba},
    \ref{sec:hzp_data_disc} and \ref{sec:available_data}, and Figures
    \ref{ass_4ba}, \ref{ass_8ba}, \ref{ass_12ba_c2}, and
