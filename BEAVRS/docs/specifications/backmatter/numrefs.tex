\begin{numitem}[Core Mass Flow Rate]{num:flowrate}
  From an email communication with the utility, the total pump flow rate is $61.5\times 10^6$ kg/hr. Normally, about 5\% of the flow goes into the bypass region, so 95\% of flow is through the core area, and the flow in the guide tubes is very low. It is assumed that this has no impact on active cooling flow. It is common to take 5\% for the flow fraction through the bypass region although it is not known precisely.

\begin{numitem}[Plenum Spring Radius]{num:plenum_spring}

  The radius for the mass of Inconel approximating the plenum spring is chosen
  to be the equivalent radius for the volume of an approximate helical spring.
  The spring wire diameter $d_{spgw}$ and number of turns $v_s$ for the helical
  spring are taken from the FRAPCON-3 Integral Assessment Document in the
  appendix regarding the Westinghouse BR-3 fuel rods, which are assumed to be
  similar to the fuel rods in this plant. The helix diameter $d_{spg}$ was
  chosen such that the ratio of the outer fuel rod cladding diameter $d_{co}$ to the
  helix diameter was the same.
  
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    v_s &= 8\,\mathrm{turns} \\
    d_{co,BR-3} &= 0.422\,\mathrm{in} \\
    d_{spg,BR-3} &= 0.37\,\mathrm{in} \\
    \\
    d_{spg} &= d_{co}\frac{d_{spg,BR-3}}{d_{co,BR-3}} = 0.3156\,\mathrm{in} \\
  \end{aligned}
\]

  From here volume of the helical spring is calculated as
  
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    V_{spring} &= v_s \pi \left(\frac{d_{spgw}}{2}\right)^2 \pi \left(d_{dspg}-d_{spgw}\right) \\
    V_{spring} &= 8 \pi \left(\frac{0.055\,\mathrm{in}}{2}\right)^2 \pi (0.3156\,\mathrm{in}-0.055\,\mathrm{in}) \\
    V_{spring} &= 0.01556\,\mathrm{in}^3
  \end{aligned}
\]

  Finally, the equivalent radius $r_e$ is found with the plenum height $h_{pl} =
  7.66\,\mathrm{in}$ as
  
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    r_e &= \sqrt{\frac{V_{spring}}{\pi h_{pl}}} \\
    r_e &= \sqrt{\frac{0.01556\,\mathrm{in}^3}{\pi 7.66\,\mathrm{in}}} \\
    r_e &= 0.02543\,\mathrm{in} \\
    r_e &= 0.06459\,\mathrm{cm} \\

\begin{numitem}[Grid Spacers]{num:grid_spacer}

  The axial positioning of the grid centers was taken from the Fuel Lattice
  worksheet. Upper and lower planes for each grid were found using the grid
  heights specified in \cite{ml033530020}.
  
  The masses for determining radial grid spacer dimensions are taken from
  Sources \ref{num:grid_in_weight}, \ref{num:grid_zr_weight}, and
  \ref{num:grid_ss_weight}.
  
  \textbf{Top/Bottom Grid Sleeve}
  
  As shown in Figure \ref{fig_grid_assembly}, the grid sleeve is a box shell
  defined by inner and outer square pitch parameters $P_i$ and $P_o$, where
  $P_i$ is found using the pin pitch as $17\times S_p$.  Using the density of
  SS304 $\rho_{SS304}$, the estimated mass for each grid $W_{SS304}$, and the
  height of the grid, the outer pitch is found as:
  
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    P_o = \sqrt{P_i^2 + \frac{W_{SS304}/\rho_{SS304}}{h_{tb}}} &=
          \sqrt{(17\times1.25984\,\mathrm{cm})^2 +
          \frac{91.0329\,\mathrm{g}/8.03\,\frac{\mathrm{g}}{\mathrm{cm}^3}}{1.322\,
          \mathrm{in}\times2.54\mathrm{\frac{cm}{in}}}} \\
        & = 21.4960\,\mathrm{cm}
  \end{aligned}
\]

  This fits between assemblies, as $P_o$ is less than the assembly pitch
  ($21.50364\,\mathrm{cm}$). The square radius reported in Figure
  \ref{fig_grid_assembly} is half of $P_o$.

  \textbf{Top/Bottom Egg-Crate}
  
  As shown in Figure \ref{fig_grid_pin_tb}, the egg-crate is defined by a box
  shell defined by inner and outer square pitch parameters $p_i$ and $p_o$,
  where $p_o$ is simply the outer pincell pitch $S_p$. It is assumed that the
  entire mass of Inconel reported from Source \ref{num:grid_in_weight} is
  uniformly distributed between all pincells in an assembly. Thus the mass of
  Inconel per pincell is $w_{in} = \frac{W_{in}}{17\times17} =
  2.69990\,\mathrm{g}$. Using this with the density of Inconel $\rho_{in}$ and
  the height of the grid, the inner pitch is found as:
  
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    p_i = \sqrt{p_o^2 - \frac{w_{in}/\rho_{in}}{h_{tb}}} &=
          \sqrt{(1.25984\,\mathrm{cm})^2 -
          \frac{2.69990\,\mathrm{g}/8.2\,\frac{\mathrm{g}}{\mathrm{cm}^3}}{1.322\,
          \mathrm{in}\times2.54\mathrm{\frac{cm}{in}}}} \\
        & = 1.22030\,\mathrm{cm}
  \end{aligned}
\]

  This fits between the pin and outer pincell pitch for all pincell types, as
  $p_i$ is greater than the guide tube diameter ($1.20396\,\mathrm{cm}$). The
  square radius reported in Figure \ref{fig_grid_pin_tb} is half of $p_i$.
  
  \textbf{Intermediate Grid Sleeve}
  
  The dimensions for the intermediate grid sleeves are taken to be identical to
  those for the top/bottom grid sleeves.
  
  \textbf{Intermediate Egg-Crate}
  
  The intermediate grid egg-crate dimensions are found in the same way as the
  top/bottom grids, using the appropriate Zircaloy masses and densities. Here,
  the weight of Zircaloy $w_{zr,egg}$ used to calculate the egg-crate dimensions
  is the total grid weight of Zircaloy $W_{zr}$ from Source
  \ref{num:grid_zr_weight}, less the weight of Zircaloy in the intermediate grid
  sleeve $w_{zr,sleeve}$, divided by the number of pincells. The weight in the
  sleeve is found using the density of Zircaloy and the volume of the sleeve
  from the intermediate grid height and the previously-calculated grid sleeve
  pitch parameters.

\[
  \begin{aligned}
    w_{zr,sleeve} &= \rho_{zr} h_{int} \left(P_o^2 - P_i^2\right) \\
                  &= 6.55 \mathrm{\frac{g}{cm^3}}\times2.25\,\mathrm{in}\times2.54\mathrm{\frac{cm}{in}}\left((21.4960\,\mathrm{cm})^2 - (21.41728\,\mathrm{cm})^2\right)\\
                  &= 126.455\,\mathrm{g}\\
                  \\
    w_{zr,egg}    &= \frac{1}{17\times17}\left ( W_{zr} - w_{zr,sleeve}\right) \\
    w_{zr,egg}    &= \frac{1}{17\times17}\left ( 1169.23\,\mathrm{g} - 126.455\,\mathrm{g}\right) \\
    w_{zr,egg}    &= 3.60850\,\mathrm{g}
  \end{aligned}
\]

\[
  \begin{aligned}
    p_i = \sqrt{p_o^2 - \frac{w_{zr,egg}/\rho_{zr}}{h_{int}}} &=
          \sqrt{(1.25984\,\mathrm{cm})^2 -
          \frac{3.60850\,\mathrm{g}/6.55\,\frac{\mathrm{g}}{\mathrm{cm}^3}}{2.25\,
          \mathrm{in}\times2.54\mathrm{\frac{cm}{in}}}} \\
        & = 1.22098\,\mathrm{cm}
  \end{aligned}
\]

  This fits between the pin and outer pincell pitch for all pincell types, as
  $p_i$ is greater than the guide tube diameter ($1.20396\,\mathrm{cm}$). The
  square radius reported in Figure \ref{fig_grid_pin_i} is half of $p_i$.

   Provided in the spreadsheet sent by the utility the initial Uranium heavy metal mass and U-235 mass are detailed for each assembly under the worksheet, Assembly Loading. These allow us to calculate U-235 enrichments and fuel density. To limit the number of materials, the average values for the enrichments were calculated. 
   
   Using the detailed assembly loadings, the actual core-averaged enrichment for the cycle 1 low-enriched bundles is $\chi_{25} = 1.61006\%$ (see Source \ref{num:assy_load}). It assumed that the enrichment of U-234 is 0.8\% of this,
\[
    \chi_{24} = 0.008\cdot 1.61006\% = 0.01288048\%.
\]
    The rest of the heavy metal in the initial fuel loading is made up of U-238 calculated as
\[
    \chi_{28} = 100\% - 1.61006\% - 0.01288048\% = 98.37705952\%.
\]

\[
    M_U = \left[ \frac{\chi_{24}}{M_{24}} + \frac{\chi_{25}}{M_{25}} + \frac{\chi_{28}}{M_{28}} \right ]^{-1} = 238.001241436\,\mathrm{amu}. 
\]
The weight fractions of Uranium in Uranium Dioxide and Oxygen in Uranium Dioxide can be determined by the following two expressions:
\[
    \omega_{U} = \frac{M_U}{M_U + 2\cdot M_O} = 0.881485944114
\]
and
\[
    \omega_{O} = 1 - \omega_{U} = 0.118514055886.

From the Uranium heavy metal weight percent, and detailed heavy metal loadings reported in the spreadsheet, the average density can be calculated. The total Uranium heavy metal mass for low enriched bundles is $m_f = 27.570971\,\mathrm{MT}$ (see Source \ref{num:assy_load}).  If there are 65 low enriched bundles, the volume can be calculated with
\[
    V_f = \pi \cdot R_f^2 \cdot H \cdot N_{assy} \cdot N_{pins}

\[
    V_f = \pi \cdot 0.39218^2 \cdot 365.76 \cdot 65 \cdot 264 = 3032733.5050\,\mathrm{cm^3}.
\]
See Sources \ref{num:fuelpellrad}, \ref{num:fuelheight} and Figures \ref{ass_base} and \ref{fig_enr_ba_pos}.

\[
    \rho_f = \frac{m_f}{V_f\cdot\omega_{U}} = 10.31341\,\mathrm{\frac{g}{cm^3}}.
\]

Isotopic number densities for Uranium are then calculated with
\[
    N = \frac{\widetilde{\rho} \cdot A}{M}.
\]
The parameter $A$ is Avagadro's number $=0.60221415\cdot 10^{24}\,\frac{atom}{mol}$ and $\widetilde{\rho}$ is the isotopic mass density. The isotopic mass density is calculated by multiplying the weight fraction of the element by the weight fraction of the isotopic in that element $\left(\omega\cdot\chi\right)$ multiplied by the fuel mass density,
\[
  \widetilde{\rho} = \rho_f\cdot \omega \cdot \chi.

\begin{numitem}[Composition of Borated Water]{num:water_mat}

    This source block describes how to compute the number density of isotopes in borated water. This block will show the necessary formulas, but the density and concentration of boron may change depending on cycle time. For a given reactor pressure and temperature, density of water is obtained from NIST. From the water density and boron weight percent, the density of borated water will be obtained.
    
    For a given concentration of boron, the weight percent of boron in water is
\[
   \omega_B = C_B\mathrm{\,\left[ppm\right]^{-1}}\times10^{-6}.
\]
The molecular mass of water can be determined from elemental masses in Source \ref{num:element_mass} as
\[
    M_{H_2O} = 2\cdot M_H + M_O.
\]
The number density of water can then be computed as
\[
    N_{H_2O} = \frac{\rho_{H_2O}\cdot A}{M_{H_2O}}.
\]
The parameter $A$ is Avagadro's number $=0.60221415\cdot 10^{24}\,\frac{atom}{mol}$. The number density of hydrogen and oxygen are given as:
\[
    N_H = 2\cdot N_{H_2O} \qquad N_O = N_{H_2O}.
\]

The density of borated water can be computed from the density of water and the weight percent of boron,
\[
    \rho_{BW} = \frac{\rho_{H_2O}}{1 - \omega_B}
\]
To compute the number density of boron, the following expression is used:
\[
    N_B = \frac{\omega_B\cdot\rho_{BW}\cdot A}{M_B}.
\]
The isotopic number densities of the elements can be calculated by multiplying the elemental number densities by isotopic abundances reported in Source \ref{num:isotopic_abund}.

\begin{numitem}[Composition of Borated Water in Nozzle and Support Plate Region]{num:water_spn_mat}

To conserve the mass of borated water in the nozzle and support plate region, the
density of borated water is adjusted using formula:

\[
    \rho^\prime_{water} = \frac{\rho_{water} \times V_{water}}{V^\prime_{water}}
\]

where $\rho_{water}$ and $V_{water}$ are the actual density and volume of water
while $\rho^\prime_{water}$ and $V^\prime_{water}$ are the density and volume
in the model.

According to Section \ref{par:nozzle}, the volume of water in the nozzle and
support plate region is

\[
   V^\prime_{water} = S_a^2 - n_{pins}\times \pi \times R_{pin}^2 = 21.50364^2 - 264\times\pi\times 0.45720^2 = 289.03961\,\rm{cm^3}
\]

From Reference \cite{ml033530020}, the volume fractions of water in the nozzle 
and support plate is 0.8280, so the actual volume of water should be:

\[
    V_{water} = S_a^2\times 0.8280 = 382.87261\,\rm{cm^3}
\]


The adjusted density of borated water is:

\[
    \rho^\prime_{water} = 0.740582067516 \times 382.87261 / 289.03961 = 0.9810025\,\rm{g/cm^3}
\]

The adjusted density can then be used to calculate number densities 
of nuclides in borated water described in Source \ref{num:water_mat}.

\begin{numitem}[Composition of Stainless Steel in Nozzle and Support Plate Region]{num:ss_spn_mat}

To conserve the mass of stainless steel in the nozzle and support plate region,
the density of stainless steel is adjusted using formula:

\[
    \rho^\prime_{ss} = \frac{\rho_{ss} \times V_{ss}}{V^\prime_{ss}}
\]

where $\rho_{ss}$ and $V_{ss}$ are the actual density and volume of stainless steel
while $\rho^\prime_{ss}$ and $V^\prime_{ss}$ are the density and volume
in the model.

According to Section \ref{par:nozzle}, the volume of stainless steel in the nozzle and
support plate region is

\[
   V^\prime_{ss} = n_{pins}\times \pi \times R_{pin}^2 = 264\times\pi\times 0.45720^2 = 173.36692\,\rm{cm^3}
\]

From Reference \cite{ml033530020}, the volume fractions of stainless steel in the nozzle 
and support plate is 0.1720, so the actual volume of stainless steel should be:

\[
    V_{ss} = S_a^2\times 0.1720 = 79.533924\,\rm{cm^3}
\]


The adjusted density of stainless steel is:

\[
    \rho^\prime_{ss} = 8.03 \times 79.533924 / 173.36692 = 3.683848\,\rm{g/cm^3}
\]

The adjusted density can then be used to calculate number densities 
of nuclides in stainless steel described in Source \ref{num:SS304_mat}.

  To determine core-averaged enrichment for each enrichment type (1.6\%, 2.4\% and 3.1\%), the Enrichment column was first separated by enrichment type. Then, all the enrichments for a given type were averaged. In order to compute densities, the total mass of Uranium is needed for each enrichment type. Both of these values are reported in the table below.
