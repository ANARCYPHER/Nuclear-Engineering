% some setup to make the assembly figures
\input{specifications/assy/figs/ass_layout_setup}

Each of the assemblies in the core is made up of a $17\times17$ array of pins
described in Section \ref{sec:pintypes}. Table \ref{table_assembly_overview}
outlines the important parameters of each, and the positions of the guide tubes
are shown in Figure \ref{ass_base}.

Assemblies are made up of one of three different enrichment fuel pins, and the
guide tube positions can be filled with one of several different burnable
absorber configurations described in Section \ref{sec:ba_configs}. For any
configuration, the center guide tube may contain an instrument tube. The details
of the layout of these features throughout the core are described in Section
\ref{sec:corespec}.

\paragraph{Burnable Absorber Configurations}
\label{sec:ba_configs}

Assemblies in the core that do not contain control rods may posses one of 5
burnable absorber configurations, or have none at all. Figures \ref{ass_4ba}
through \ref{ass_20ba} depict these configurations. Each configuration appears
in all four quadrants of the core, and thus the 6BA and 5BA configurations need
to be rotated as indicated. Note that the 12BA configuration is different
between cycle 1 and cycle 2.

\paragraph[Radial Grid Spacer Specifications]{Radial Grid Spacer Specifications\texorpdfstring{\protect\sechypt{grid_spec}{}}{}}
\label{sec:rad_grids}

In axial regions containing spacers, dimensions are chosen to conserve the total
weight of Inconel, Zircaloy, and stainless steel in each grid, as listed in
Table \ref{table_assembly_overview}. The present model creates an egg-crate
structure around each pincell as well as a sleeve around assemblies.
%, but further
%simplifications might be employed as discussed in Section
%\ref{sec:simplifications}.

The middle six grid spacers consist entirely of Zircaloy while the top and bottom
spacers consist of a \ac{SS304} sleeve with Inconel internal structures. As described
in Source \ref{num:grid_spacer}, for the top/bottom grids the entire mass of the
Inconel was distributed evenly among each of the 289 pincells in box of
appropriate thickness inside the outer edges of the pincells. Additionally, the
stainless steel mass of the grid sleeve was placed in a box of
appropriate thickness around the outside of the assembly, fitting inside the
region between assemblies. The 6 intermediate grids also consist of both
these regions (outer grid sleeve and inner egg-crate), filled with Zircaloy.
This was done for a top/bottom grid height of 1.322in and an intermediate grid
height of 2.25in, with the same grid sleeve dimensions for each grid type.  The
inner egg-crate dimensions differ between each grid type.

Figures \ref{fig_grid_pin_tb} and \ref{fig_grid_pin_i} show the modified pincell
geometry used for the inner grid structure around a fuel pin for each grid type,
where the box thicknesses are chosen to conserve mass in the total grid. The
same box is also placed around the guide tube pincells for each grid type.

Figure \ref{fig_grid_assembly} shows the dimensions of the grid sleeve
assemblies in all grid spacer regions. To see what this looks like
in combination with the inner structural component in the pincells see Figure
\ref{fig_grid_assembly_zoom}, which shows an image of what the aggregate grid
spacer model looks like to scale.
