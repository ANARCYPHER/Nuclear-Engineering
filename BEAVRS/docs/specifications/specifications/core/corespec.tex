\subsubsection{Core Specification}
\label{sec:corespec}

The remainder of the radial specification is made up of the building blocks 
defined in the previous sections. Specifically, the main core lattice of fuel
assemblies is made up of the previously described fuel assemblies, separated by
the fuel assembly lattice pitch specified in Table
\ref{table_assembly_overview}. In addition, specifications for the structural
components surrounding the fuel assembly lattice are given in Table
\ref{table_baff_vess}.

\paragraph{Enrichment Zones and Burnable Absorber Positions}
\label{sec:corespec_enrba}

The initial cycle 1 fuel assembly loading pattern is shown in Figure
\ref{fig_enr_ba_pos}, including the distribution of enrichments as well as
burnable absorber locations.  The burnable absorber configurations here are
described in Section \ref{sec:ba_configs}, rotated as appropriate for core
symmetry.  A scale view of burnable absorber pins depicting these rotations is
shown in Figure \ref{fig_ba_pos_real}.

Figure \ref{fig_enr_ba_pos_c2} shows the shuffling pattern for cycle 2, which
includes 64 fresh assemblies and a different burnable absorber pattern.

\paragraph{Control Rod Bank Positions}

Each of the four control rod banks - specified by the identifiers A, B, C, and D
- are made up of several control rod clusters in multiple fuel assemblies. In
control rod clusters, every guide tube is filled with the control rod pincell
described in section \ref{sec:pintypes}, with the exception of the center
tube. Each of the clusters in a given control rod bank move together.

In addition to the control rod banks, 5 shutdown banks of control rod clusters
are included above the core - specified by $\mathrm{S}_\mathrm{A}$,
$\mathrm{S}_\mathrm{B}$, $\mathrm{S}_\mathrm{C}$, $\mathrm{S}_\mathrm{D}$, and
$\mathrm{S}_\mathrm{E}$. These clusters are not used in normal operation,
however, their reactivity worth was measured and reported in Table
\ref{tbl:meas_c1phys}.

Figure \ref{fig_cr_pos} shows the radial locations of control rod clusters
belonging to each control rod and shutdown bank. The axial specifications of
each are described later in Section \ref{sec:axial_cr}.

The positions of control rod banks do not change between cycle 1 and cycle 2.

\paragraph{Instrument Tube Positions}
\label{sec:coreinstrpos}

The central guide tube for many fuel assemblies in the core is filled by an
instrument tube, as described in Section \ref{sec:pintypes}. Figure
\ref{fig_instr_pos} shows these positions. Where not indicated, the central
guide tube is filled with water, as described in section \ref{sec:pintypes}.

The positions of instrument tubes do not change between cycle 1 and cycle 2.
