\section{Benchmark Specifications}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Overview}

The core geometry specifications are described in 3 levels of increasing scope,
detailing each of the hierarchical elements of the model. First the radial
geometry is described, followed by a section detailing the axial parameters.

At the lowest level, the radial geometry of each of the pincell types used
throughout the core is described. Next, the fuel assembly design is detailed, 
including the possible configurations of burnable absorbers and the radial
specification of the grid spacers. Finally, the greater core geometry is
described, including the fuel assembly enrichment locations, the positions of
burnable absorbers, instrument tubes, control rod banks, and shutdown banks, as
well as the baffle that surrounds the fuel assemblies, the core barrel, four
neutron shield panels, and the reactor pressure vessel and liner.

After the radial and axial geometry descriptions, a material specifications
section lists the details of each of the materials referred to.
%Finally, the last section details the approximations made by this model and
%suggests addition approximations that might be appropriate.
Table \ref{overview_table} provides a summary of key model parameters that will
be specified in greater detail in subsequent sections, and Figure
\ref{fig_overview} shows a core cross section indicating the radial structures
and assembly loading pattern.

%\subsection{Notes on Simplifications}
%\label{sec:simplifications}

%\subsubsection{List of Simplifications}

%A list of the main simplifications employed in the previously described model is
%presented in Table \ref{table_simps}.

%\begin{table}[htpb]

%  \caption{Key simplifications. \label{table_simps}}
%  \begin{tabular}{l}
%    \\
%    \hline\hline
%    \\ undetailed support plate, nozzles, end plugs for fuel rods, BAs, and CRs
%    \\ guessed pin plenum spring radius
%    \\ guessed shield pad thickness
%    \\ guessed RPV thickness
%    \\ no startup rods (they replace BAs in some places)
%    \\ inaccurate lower and upper core plenums
%    \\ thermal pad positioning
%  \end{tabular}

%\end{table}

%\subsubsection{Radial Symmetry}

%The only source of radial asymmetry is from the instrument tubes. If ignored,
%octant symmetry might be used to cut down the size of the problem significantly.


%\subsubsection{Grid Spacer Simplifications}

%The important thing here is to conserve the mass, so if desired the stainless
%steel and inconel can be smeared together and distributed eveny accross the
%assembly as desired, either with a similar box geometry as presented here or as
%additional rings around each of the pins.  This could confine the construction
%of the axial geometry to only the pincells, simplifying the fuel assembly
%construction.
