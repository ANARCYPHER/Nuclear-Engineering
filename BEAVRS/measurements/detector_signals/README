The detector map folders for each cycle contain:

  summary

    Document containing a listing of the data passes that were processed to
    produce the detector maps, as well as a few plots and tables of the data.
    Also shows boron concentrations and the number of steps withdrawn for each
    control rod bank.

  axial_signals

    Datafile containing the processed axial trace for each detector location
    with valid data.  Signals are listed from bottom to top (i.e. the first row
    is at the bottom of the core and the last row is the top of the core)

  radial_measurements_full

    Datafile containing the axially-integrated detector signals, normalized such
    that the sum of the integrated signals adds up to the number detector
    locations (see specifications document).

  radial_measurements_full_tc

    Datafile containing the tilt-corrected maps of axially-integrated detector
    signals (see specifications document). Note that there is no definitive
    explanation for why this tilt in the data arises or the validity of the
    planar tilt correction, so this data should be utilized at the userâ€™s own
    discretion.

  radial_measurements_quarter

    Datafile containing the same axially-integrated detector signals as
    radial_measurements_full, folded to quarter core. The second and third data
    columns are the number of averaged signals and the standard deviation of the
    values for that position, if applicable.
