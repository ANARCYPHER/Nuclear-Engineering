Uranium Fuel Rods /// Main reactor fuel, uranium rods (1661) placed inside each pressure tube. Rod consists of 18 strings of small uranium pellet and one carrier rod, rods are hermetically closed in zircaloy tubes filled with helium, to prevent contamination of water with fuel decay.
Pressure Tubes /// Many small pipes (1661) through which flows water and steam. Water is inputted at bottom of core, heated, becoming steam at upper part of core where is outputed. Each pipe is separately controlled and monitored by ECCS.
Upper Control Rods /// Boron control rods (167), pulled at top of reactor to control fission. Boron absorbs neutrons needed for fission. If rods are pulled up, more neutrons can pass between rods, being slowed down, and colide with uranium in other rods.
CRC Channel /// Channel in which are control rods. Through it passes water cooling down control rods and removes by-products. If control rods aren't cooled, they will loose ability to absorb neutrons, making it harder to control fission.
Lower Control Rods /// Boron control rods (32), pulled at bottom of reactor, for controlling fission at lower parts where is lower temperature.
Startup Neutron Sources /// Rods (12) inserted in core to initialise critical reaction at startup. Rods are later completly removed. 
Graphite Moderator /// Graphire blocks with holes through which pass all rods and tubes. Graphite is used as moderator to slow down neutrons. Only slow neutrons will hit fissile atom, make it unstable and force it to fission. Fast neutrons will just push out other neutron. Steam (also called void) is strong moderator too.
