MICHAEL SHORT: Hey guys, hope
you enjoyed the brief break

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,210
from the heavy technical stuff.

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,085
Because we're going to
get right back into it

11
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:31,222
and develop the neutron
transport equation today,

12
00:00:31,222 --> 00:00:32,680
the one that you
see on everybody's

13
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,470
t-shirts here in the department.

14
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,550
So I think multiple
years folks have

15
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,940
used this equation on the
back of t-shirts just be like,

16
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,540
we're awesome.

17
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,940
And we do difficult math.

18
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,563
Well, this is what you're
going to start to do it.

19
00:00:45,563 --> 00:00:47,230
In fact, it's big
enough and hard enough

20
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,770
that we're going to spend
all day today developing it,

21
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,080
like actually writing out
the terms of the equation

22
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,390
and understanding what
it actually means.

23
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,490
Before, on Thursday
and Friday, we're

24
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,580
going to reduce it down to
a much simpler equation,

25
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,680
something that you can
actually solve and do

26
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,080
some simple reactor
calculations with.

27
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,100
We started off the whole idea of
the neutron transport equation

28
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,710
as a way to track some
population of neutrons.

29
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,770
Let's see, I'm going to have
our variable list up here.

30
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,763
What I'll probably do is
on Thursday and Friday

31
00:01:19,763 --> 00:01:21,430
I'll just have it
back up on the screens

32
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,097
so that we don't have
to write it twice.

33
00:01:23,097 --> 00:01:25,985
But there's going to be a lot
of variables in this equation.

34
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:27,610
I'm going to do my
best, again, to make

35
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:31,240
the difference between V and nu
very obvious, and anything else

36
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,230
like that.

37
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,940
But the goal is to track
some population of neutrons,

38
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,330
at some position,
at some energy,

39
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:45,110
traveling in some direction
omega, as a function of time.

40
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,060
And the 3D representation of
what we're looking at here

41
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,250
is let's say we had some
small volume element, which

42
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,370
we'll call that our dV.

43
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,100
That's got normal vectors
sticking out of it.

44
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,550
We'll call those n-hats
in all directions.

45
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:08,530
And inside there, let's say
if this is our energy scale,

46
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,850
we're tracking the
population of neutrons

47
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:18,540
that occupies some
small energy group dE,

48
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,700
and is also traveling
in some small direction

49
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,092
that we designate as d-omega.

50
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,660
So that's the goal of
this whole equation

51
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,970
is to track the number of
neutrons at any given position.

52
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:37,730
So let's call this
distance, or the vector r.

53
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,390
In this little volume, traveling
in some direction omega,

54
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:46,550
with some infinitesimally
small energy group d.

55
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,100
That's going to be the
goal of the whole thing.

56
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,900
And what we'll do
is write this to say

57
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,220
the change in the population of
neutrons at a given distance,

58
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:03,910
energy, angle, and
time, over time

59
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,440
is just going to be a sum
of gain and loss terms.

60
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,190
And what I think we'll
take all day today to do

61
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,440
is to figure out what are
the actual physical things

62
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,800
that neutrons can do in
and out of this volume,

63
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,990
and how do we turn those
into math, something

64
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,980
that we can abstract and solve?

65
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,020
There's a couple
other terms that we're

66
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,710
going to put up here.

67
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,210
We'll say that the flux of
neutrons, which is usually

68
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,960
the variable that
we actually track,

69
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,120
is just the velocity times
the neutron population.

70
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:46,540
And also let's define some
angularly independent terms.

71
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:52,150
Because in the end
we've been talking

72
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,480
about what's the
probability of some neutron

73
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,000
or particle interacting
with some electron going out

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,230
at some angle.

75
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,840
But as we're interested in
how many neutrons are there

76
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,690
in the reactor, we usually
don't care in which direction

77
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,440
they're traveling.

78
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,350
So the first simplification
that we will do

79
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,812
is get rid of any sort
of angular dependence,

80
00:04:10,812 --> 00:04:12,520
getting rid of two of
the seven variables

81
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,995
that we're dealing with here.

82
00:04:13,995 --> 00:04:15,370
So all these
variables right here

83
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,170
will be dependent on angle.

84
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,670
And all these
variables right here

85
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:24,930
will be angularly independent.

86
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,590
So there'll be some
corresponding capital

87
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:36,260
N, or number of neutrons as
a function of r, E, and t.

88
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,320
We'll call this Flux.

89
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,340
We'll call this Number.

90
00:04:45,813 --> 00:04:47,730
There's going to be a
number of cross sections

91
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,897
that we need to worry about.

92
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:53,820
So we'll refer to little
sigma as a function of energy,

93
00:04:53,820 --> 00:05:03,390
as our micro-cross-section,
and big sigma of E

94
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,220
as a macroscopic cross-section.

95
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:16,355
Then you want to remember the
relation between these two.

96
00:05:16,355 --> 00:05:17,840
AUDIENCE: Solid angle?

97
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,660
MICHAEL SHORT: The
solid angle, not quite.

98
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,598
That's, let's see.

99
00:05:22,598 --> 00:05:24,140
There's a difference
between-- and so

100
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,030
what these physically
mean is little sigma

101
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,977
means the probability of
interaction with one particle.

102
00:05:28,977 --> 00:05:30,560
And this is just the
total probability

103
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,893
of interaction with all the
particles that may be there.

104
00:05:32,893 --> 00:05:33,748
So yeah, Chris?

105
00:05:33,748 --> 00:05:34,790
AUDIENCE: Number density?

106
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,550
MICHAEL SHORT: There's
number density.

107
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,770
Already we have another
variable conflict.

108
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,930
How do we want to resolve this?

109
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:43,440
Let's see.

110
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,962
We'll have to change
the symbol somehow.

111
00:05:48,962 --> 00:05:52,195
Let's make it cursive.

112
00:05:52,195 --> 00:05:53,320
Don't know what else to do.

113
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,195
I don't want to give it
a number other than n

114
00:05:55,195 --> 00:05:57,030
since we're talking
about neutrons,

115
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,155
or that right here it's
going to be number density.

116
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,350
And in the end, we're worried
about some sort of reaction

117
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:11,150
rate, which is always
going to equal some flux,

118
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:15,470
or let's just stick with some
angularly dependent flux,

119
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:23,330
that r, E omega t,
times some cross-section

120
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,800
as a function of energy.

121
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,460
And it's these
reaction rates that

122
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,690
are the rates of gains
and losses of neutrons

123
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,300
out of this volume, out
of this little angle,

124
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,970
out of this energy group,
and out of that space,

125
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,600
or into that volume
energy group and space.

126
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,780
So let's see, other terms
that we'll want to define

127
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:48,000
include nu, like last time.

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,280
We'll call this
neutron multiplication.

129
00:06:56,523 --> 00:06:57,940
In other words,
this is the number

130
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,690
of neutrons made on average
during each fission event.

131
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,790
And we give it energy
dependence because as we

132
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,170
saw on the Janis libraries
on Friday, I think it was.

133
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,320
What's today, Tuesday?

134
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,690
I don't even know anymore.

135
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,960
I think as we saw on Friday,
that depends on energy

136
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,615
for the higher energy levels.

137
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:19,550
And there's also
going to be some Kai

138
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:30,010
spectrum, or some
neutron birth spectrum,

139
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,130
which tells you the average
energy at which neutrons

140
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,180
are born from fission.

141
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,980
So regardless of what energy
goes in to cause the fission,

142
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,470
there's some
probability distribution

143
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,280
of a neutron being born
at a certain energy.

144
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:53,910
And it looks something like
this, where that's about 1 MeV.

145
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,160
That's about 10 MeV.

146
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,158
And that average right
there is around 2 MeV.

147
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:01,950
And so it's important
to note that neutrons

148
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,360
are born at different energies.

149
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,850
Because we want to track
every single possible dE

150
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,340
throughout this
control volume, which

151
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,400
we'll also call a reactor.

152
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,930
Let's see, what other
terms will we need to know?

153
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,520
The different types
of cross sections,

154
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,320
or the different
interactions that neutrons

155
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,520
can have with matter.

156
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,645
What are some of the ones
that we had talked about?

157
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,590
What can neutrons do
when they run into stuff?

158
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,350
AUDIENCE: Scatter.

159
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,683
MICHAEL SHORT: They can scatter.

160
00:08:27,683 --> 00:08:31,111
So there's going to be some
scattering cross-section.

161
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:35,409
And when they scatter,
the important part

162
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:37,159
here is they're going
to change in energy.

163
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,610
What else can they do?

164
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,110
Yeah?

165
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,820
AUDIENCE: Absorbed.

166
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,820
MICHAEL SHORT: They
can be absorbed.

167
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,640
So we'll have some
sigma absorption.

168
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,210
What are some of the various
things that can happen

169
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,395
when a neutron is absorbed?

170
00:09:02,196 --> 00:09:03,200
AUDIENCE: Fission.

171
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,810
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, so
one of them is fission.

172
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,656
What are some of the other ones?

173
00:09:14,656 --> 00:09:15,406
AUDIENCE: Capture.

174
00:09:15,406 --> 00:09:16,590
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep, capture.

175
00:09:23,232 --> 00:09:25,190
What were some of the
ones that we talked about

176
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,740
during the Chadwick paper?

177
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,180
AUDIENCE: Neutron [INAUDIBLE].

178
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,260
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep,
so there can be some--

179
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:38,710
we'll call it n,in, which means
one neutron goes in, i neutrons

180
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:47,420
come out, so 1 to
i neutrons, sure.

181
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,100
Anything else?

182
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,935
Encompassed in absorption?

183
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,385
Well when we refer to scatter
here, what type of scattering

184
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:03,260
are we talking about?

185
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:09,660
AUDIENCE: Compton's scatter?

186
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,385
MICHAEL SHORT:
Compton's for photons.

187
00:10:11,385 --> 00:10:13,260
It's OK.

188
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,420
Was it elastic or
inelastic scattering?

189
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,170
AUDIENCE: Elastic.

190
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,640
MICHAEL SHORT:
Elastic scattering.

191
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,430
So another thing you could call
an absorption event, depending

192
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:30,150
on what bin you put things
in, is inelastic scattering,

193
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,590
which is that kind of--

194
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,110
we call it scattering
because one neutron goes in,

195
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,610
one neutron comes out.

196
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,510
But in reality, you have
a compound nucleus forming

197
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,920
and a neutron emitted from
a different energy level.

198
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,760
So it doesn't follow the
simple ballistic laws of,

199
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,850
and kinematic laws of
inelastic scattering.

200
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,050
What else can neutrons do?

201
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:54,050
Now we're getting into
the real esoteric stuff.

202
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,883
But I want to see if
you guys have any idea.

203
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:02,640
Did you know that
neutrons can decay?

204
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,080
A low neutron is actually
not a stable particle.

205
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,130
If you look up on the
Kyrie table of nuclides,

206
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,460
it's got a half
life of 12 minutes.

207
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,170
So if you happen
to be able to have

208
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,570
neutrons in a bottle or
something, which we actually

209
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,640
can do.

210
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,320
There's centers for
ultra-cold neutrons and atoms.

211
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,933
There's one at North Carolina
State where they actually cool

212
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:27,350
down neutrons to cryogenic
temperatures to the point where

213
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,150
they can actually confine them.

214
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,540
They only live on
average 12 minutes.

215
00:11:37,212 --> 00:11:38,920
And then there would
also be what we call

216
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,810
a neutron-neutron interactions.

217
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,330
There is a finite,
non-zero but very small

218
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:50,870
probability that neutrons
can hit other neutrons.

219
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:55,970
But the mean-free path for
these is on the order of 10

220
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,495
to the 8th centimeters.

221
00:11:59,495 --> 00:12:01,370
So this is not something
we have to consider.

222
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,350
But it's interesting to
know that yes, neutrons

223
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,090
can run into other neutrons.

224
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,280
And these sorts of things
have been measured.

225
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,680
We won't have to
worry about this.

226
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,810
We won't have to worry
about neutron decay.

227
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,060
But it's interesting to note
that a low neutron is not

228
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,460
a stable particle.

229
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:20,000
It will spontaneously
undergo beta decay,

230
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,520
into a proton and an electron.

231
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,510
Pretty neat, huh?

232
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:30,220
Anyway, if we sum up all
these possible interactions,

233
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,340
we have one other
cross-section, which

234
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,330
we're going to call the total
cross-section, the probability

235
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,600
of absolutely any
interaction occurring at all.

236
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,260
Because any sort of
interaction of that neutron

237
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:49,520
is going to cause removal from
this group of energy position,

238
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,450
angle, location, whatever.

239
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,570
Whether it's absorption, or
fission, or elastic scattering,

240
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,300
or inelastic scattering,
any sort of event--

241
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,870
except for forward scattering,
which means nothing happens--

242
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,530
is going to result in this
neutron either leaving

243
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,160
the volume.

244
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,100
So it might scatter out
of our little volume.

245
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,180
Or it might change direction,
scatter out of our d-omega.

246
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,080
Or it will lose
some energy, or gain

247
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,920
some energy, in some cases,
leaving our little dE, which

248
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,057
is what we're trying to track.

249
00:13:23,057 --> 00:13:24,640
Because we're actually
tracking what's

250
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,580
the population of neutrons
in this little dE,

251
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,210
in this direction, in this
position, at this time.

252
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,760
And supposedly if we
know this term fully,

253
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,200
we can solve for
all the neutrons

254
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,408
everywhere, anywhere in the
reactor with full information.

255
00:13:38,408 --> 00:13:40,200
So what we'll spend
the rest of today doing

256
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,300
is figuring out what are all the
possible gain and loss terms.

257
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,940
So let's start just putting them
out physically, or in words.

258
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,740
And then we'll put them to math.

259
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,160
So what are some of the
ways in which neutrons

260
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,630
can enter our little group
of volume, angle, and energy?

261
00:14:01,414 --> 00:14:04,940
How are neutrons created?

262
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,580
Yeah, Luke?

263
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,830
AUDIENCE: From fission,
or a neutron emission.

264
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,010
MICHAEL SHORT: From fission,
yeah, so that's one big source.

265
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,650
So we'll call this a gains.

266
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,550
This is a losses.

267
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,900
And you said a neutron source.

268
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,942
Can you be more specific?

269
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,260
AUDIENCE: A neutron
emission, like [INAUDIBLE]..

270
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:29,190
MICHAEL SHORT: OK, so we'll
say n,in reactions, right?

271
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,170
OK, cool.

272
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,505
How else can we gain neutrons?

273
00:14:37,164 --> 00:14:38,600
AUDIENCE: Fusion?

274
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,800
MICHAEL SHORT: Fusion?

275
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,390
OK.

276
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,010
That is true.

277
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,690
Although fusion
reactors don't really

278
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,380
operate on the principle of
neutron criticality, or neutron

279
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,312
balance.

280
00:14:49,312 --> 00:14:50,770
So this discussion
for now is going

281
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,310
to be limited to
fission reactors.

282
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,690
But yeah, good point.

283
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,540
Fusion does make neutrons.

284
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,080
What else?

285
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:02,710
Yeah?

286
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:07,225
AUDIENCE: They could enter from
one of the adjacent volume?

287
00:15:07,225 --> 00:15:09,600
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, they
could come from somewhere else,

288
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,620
right?

289
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,415
Let's just call that
an external source.

290
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,300
In the books and
in your reading,

291
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,750
you'll just see them
treat this external source

292
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:28,900
as some variable s
of r, E, omega, t.

293
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,700
So you'll just see this
treated as s, a source,

294
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,990
with no further explanation.

295
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,490
It's like, oh, math
says that there

296
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,845
could be external sources.

297
00:15:39,845 --> 00:15:41,970
But I want to tell you
where they really come from.

298
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,190
Most reactors
nowadays don't just

299
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,860
start up when you throw a
bunch of uranium into a pool

300
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,510
and pull out the control rods.

301
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,580
You actually have to stick in--

302
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,530
if this is your little
reactor right here--

303
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:57,630
you actually have to stick in
a little piece of californium--

304
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,630
I think the isotope is 252--

305
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:03,080
as what we call a
kickstarter source.

306
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:09,120
So californium is made mostly
in the HFIR, or the High Flux

307
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,980
Isotope Reactor, at the Oakridge
National Lab in Tennessee,

308
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,980
where they have a really,
really high power reactor.

309
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,780
It's 85 megawatts.

310
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,050
It's about that big
around and this tall.

311
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,490
It's really, really small.

312
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,580
For reference, that's about
the size of the MIT reactor,

313
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,530
except our reactor's
6 megawatts.

314
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,510
Theirs is 85 megawatts.

315
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,690
And it's designed to be
an incredibly high flux,

316
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,630
to go by neutron capture, and
neutron capture reactions,

317
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:41,430
to build up californium
252, which is spontaneously

318
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,110
giving off neutrons like crazy.

319
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:48,800
And this right here, that's
your external source.

320
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,790
And this helps get
reactors going.

321
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,560
Because you can
either very slowly

322
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,690
wait for the fission
reaction to build up

323
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,950
in a controlled manner.

324
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,620
Or you can give it a kick in
the pants and get it going.

325
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,960
This HFIR reactor
is pretty cool.

326
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,750
Like I said, it's 85 megawatts.

327
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,940
And it's about as
dense as it can get.

328
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,880
The fuel is actually made by
explosively bonding sheets

329
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,190
of uranium in a certain sort of
semi-cylindrical configuration.

330
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,369
And it produces so much
decay heat in so little space

331
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,230
that if it were to lose
cooling, the reactor

332
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,206
would melt in 8 seconds.

333
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,530
You usually have
days or so before

334
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:26,200
that happens in a
conventional reactor

335
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,840
because the power density
just isn't that high.

336
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,970
So you can actually
see down to the tank

337
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,090
that contains HFIR if you go
for a tour at Oakridge National

338
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:34,870
Lab.

339
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,630
And it's way down below this
gigantic like, not quite

340
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,883
Olympic, but getting
there sized pool of water,

341
00:17:40,883 --> 00:17:42,550
just to make sure
that there is adequate

342
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,910
cooling for this thing.

343
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,250
It's intense.

344
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,380
But that's just a notice
that these external sources,

345
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,520
these are real things that
we use in power reactors

346
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,960
to get them going.

347
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,750
What are some other ways
that one could make neutrons,

348
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,170
or that neutrons could
enter into our energy group?

349
00:18:04,515 --> 00:18:06,640
And the silence is expected
because this is usually

350
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,490
the hardest part of
developing this equation.

351
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,720
And I want to introduce it.

352
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,466
Yeah, Luke?

353
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
scattering, too.

354
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,465
MICHAEL SHORT:
That's exactly it.

355
00:18:14,465 --> 00:18:15,580
They can scatter in.

356
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,910
So when we develop this
neutron transport equation,

357
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:21,370
we're not just
tracking the neutrons

358
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:25,450
in this little energy group dE,
direction, d-omega, and volume

359
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,290
dV.

360
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:29,320
You actually have to know what's
the population of neutrons

361
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,030
in every single group.

362
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:34,210
Because you might have a neutron
at a higher energy level that

363
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:40,245
undergoes scattering from
some different energy,

364
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:43,650
E-prime into our energy group.

365
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:49,030
So continuing with our
gigantic list of variables,

366
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,730
we're going to call E
is, we'll say r energy.

367
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,408
And this vector omega
is our direction,

368
00:18:57,408 --> 00:18:58,575
the one that we're tracking.

369
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,500
And E-prime is going to
be some other energy.

370
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,260
And omega-vector-prime is
going to be some coming

371
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,670
from some other direction.

372
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,010
And like Luke said,
this is what we

373
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:30,740
would refer to as in-scattering,
which means some neutron comes,

374
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,960
that was going in a
different direction, that

375
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,000
did have a different
energy, and has now

376
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,832
entered into the single
group that we're tracking.

377
00:19:37,832 --> 00:19:40,040
Eventually we're going to
integrate over all energies

378
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,270
to track all energy groups.

379
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,960
So that's where we're going.

380
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,530
And there's one more term that
I want to introduce right now.

381
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,330
It's what's called
the scattering kernel.

382
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,440
Don't ask me why
it's called kernel.

383
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,400
But this is just the terminology
I want you guys to get used to.

384
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,370
And there's going to be some
sort of probability function

385
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:08,210
where a neutron starts off at
a different energy, E-prime,

386
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,170
and in a different
direction, omega-prime.

387
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:17,920
And it enters into our group
energy E and direction omega.

388
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,430
Right now we'll leave it as
a highly general function.

389
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,990
What we're going to find
later is there's just

390
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:26,440
some sort of simple line to it.

391
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,140
If you guys remember, if
some neutron starts off,

392
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:37,170
let's see, probability of
entering into some energy

393
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,190
group.

394
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,110
If you notice, if you
remember from last time,

395
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:43,650
the neutron, when it undergoes
any sort of scattering

396
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:47,460
reaction, can end
up with any energy

397
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:53,280
between its original energy
for the case of theta equals 0,

398
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,710
and this parameter, alpha
energy, for the case theta

399
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:01,220
equals pi, where
alpha is A minus 1,

400
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,870
over A plus 1 squared,
where A is the atomic mass.

401
00:21:09,927 --> 00:21:12,010
You guys remember this
from back in the Q equation

402
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,320
days, when we were
finding out what's

403
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,320
the probability that a neutron
coming in with energy E

404
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,580
ends up at any energy E-prime?

405
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,480
Actually I'll just write this
as the scattering kernel.

406
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,120
What it ends up looking
like, in most cases,

407
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,260
is just a flat line.

408
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:32,550
There's an equal probability of
the neutron ending up anywhere

409
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:37,070
between energy E and
anywhere between energy

410
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,960
alpha-E. It's actually a
pretty simple function.

411
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,517
It's just a constant value
here and 0 everywhere else.

412
00:21:44,517 --> 00:21:46,100
What that means is
that if, let's say,

413
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,890
a neutron hits a uranium
atom, there is no way in hell

414
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,050
that it can transfer
all of its energy

415
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:56,720
to a uranium atom because
of conservation of energy

416
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,250
and momentum, like we've
been harping on for kind

417
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,150
of this whole class.

418
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,940
What's the only time that
this alpha-E could actually

419
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,110
extend all the way to 0?

420
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,790
What case would that be?

421
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

422
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,838
AUDIENCE: You're
hitting another neutron.

423
00:22:14,838 --> 00:22:17,047
MICHAEL SHORT: You're hitting
another neutron, which,

424
00:22:17,047 --> 00:22:18,660
as we said, is a
very rare event.

425
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,770
That is true.

426
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,312
Or what else could
you be hitting?

427
00:22:21,312 --> 00:22:22,790
AUDIENCE: A proton?

428
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,930
MICHAEL SHORT: A proton,
hydrogen. That's right.

429
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:28,110
So it can only be,
let's say you can only

430
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,690
have the probability of
the neutron ending up

431
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:39,130
with any energy for the case
of hydrogen. Incidentally,

432
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,260
this is why we fill
light water reactors

433
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,420
with hydrogen.
The goal is to get

434
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,080
the neutrons as slow as
possible as quick as possible.

435
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,060
Interesting sentence
to say there, right?

436
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,420
We want the neutrons to be
as low energy as possible

437
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,340
as rapidly as possible.

438
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,770
And the best way to do
that is to fill the reactor

439
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:00,070
with hydrogen because then any
collision could, in theory, get

440
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,260
the neutron down to zero energy.

441
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,680
Without water, or something
with the same mass as a neutron,

442
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,600
like another neutron,
there is no way

443
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,688
that that neutron can
slow down by very much.

444
00:23:11,688 --> 00:23:13,230
So even though we're
going to keep it

445
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,260
as this generalized function,
note that in reality it's

446
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,270
this pretty simple function.

447
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,190
It changes a little
bit, as there

448
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:24,030
can be a forward scattering
bias for some neutron reactions.

449
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:27,000
But we are not going to
deal with that this year.

450
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,890
You will deal with that
next year in 22.05.

451
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,840
So I've been saying a
lot, oh, well, we're

452
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,423
not going to go into this topic
because you're going to see it

453
00:23:35,423 --> 00:23:37,220
in 22.02, which is quantum.

454
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,050
Now I switched
gears to say, we're

455
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,630
not going to go into the
way this function changes

456
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,940
because you'll see it
next year in 22.05,

457
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,500
which is neutron physics.

458
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,490
But for now I want you
to be prepared for 22.05.

459
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:53,315
So we'll put on in-scattering
as one of our gains.

460
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:58,660
There's a last one I want
to make you aware of.

461
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,143
We very briefly touched upon it.

462
00:24:00,143 --> 00:24:02,560
But I wouldn't be surprised
if no one remembers because it

463
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,935
was for like 10 seconds.

464
00:24:04,935 --> 00:24:06,310
It's what's called
photo fission.

465
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:13,200
What this means is you have some
reaction that would, in comes

466
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,190
a gamma, and out goes fission.

467
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,310
This actually does start to
happen around 3 or 4 MeV,

468
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:25,030
for isotopes like uranium 235.

469
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:29,800
And in our reactor, whatever
shape we decide it is,

470
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,950
there are tons of gamma rays
flying about in all directions

471
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,020
at very high energy.

472
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,770
Does anyone remember
where they come from?

473
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,930
Anyone remember the
fission timeline

474
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:48,760
that we drew on Friday?

475
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,240
So what we said
there was right away,

476
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,440
let's say fission happens.

477
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,520
And almost instantly, you
get your fission product one

478
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,750
and fission product two.

479
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,100
And they move around
for a little while.

480
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,925
And then some of them
will emit some neutrons.

481
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:13,110
And then some of them will
start to emit gamma rays, betas,

482
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:19,160
and whatever else they're
going to do until they finally

483
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,370
lose all their kinetic energy
and stop in the surrounding

484
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:26,330
fuel, creating the heat that
actually powers the turbine

485
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:29,210
and make steam to
make electricity.

486
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,400
And so it's from these
gammas, as well as

487
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,150
any of the gammas from the
decay products of the fission

488
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:38,990
products that lead to a huge
flux of gamma rays firing out

489
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,640
from all sides in the reactor.

490
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,807
That's one of the main
things that you actually have

491
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,750
to shield in a nuclear reactor.

492
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,570
Since we talked about all
sorts of different shielding,

493
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:50,450
and all sorts of ways that
you have to shield things,

494
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,630
you know from seeing the MIT
reactor-- which you all did--

495
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:56,270
that there's like six
feet of lead and concrete

496
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,100
shielding around the reactor.

497
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,470
It's not there to shield
the alphas and the betas,

498
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:03,090
because those don't really
make it out of the water.

499
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,750
It's not there to shield
the soft X-rays that betas

500
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,120
make from bremsstrahlung.

501
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,630
It's also not there
to shield the neutrons

502
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,380
because the neutrons
don't really get out.

503
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,300
They bounce around, or
get absorbed in the water,

504
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,840
or the fuel, the reflector.

505
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,820
It's there to shield the
high-energy gamma rays.

506
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,200
Because the only
thing that stops

507
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,750
high energy gamma
rays is lots of mass

508
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,480
in between the source and you.

509
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,350
So we know there's tons
of gammas all about.

510
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:36,020
So let's say there's also going
to be some gamma ray flux.

511
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,510
There'll be some
gamma ray energy.

512
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:42,740
And there'll be some
cross-section for photo fission

513
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:48,240
as a function of the incoming
gamma ray energy spectrum.

514
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,660
Now I'm adding terms to the ones
that you'll see in the reading

515
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,350
because drawing them out in math
is actually fairly instructive.

516
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,810
They all follow
the same pattern.

517
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,560
So instead of just
showing you one of each

518
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,715
and saying memorize, we'll
develop a whole lot of these.

519
00:27:01,715 --> 00:27:03,090
And you'll find
out that they all

520
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,660
actually look almost the same.

521
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:11,257
Can anyone else think of any
possible gains of neutrons?

522
00:27:11,257 --> 00:27:12,590
Where else could they come from?

523
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,340
Yeah?

524
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,407
AUDIENCE: Neutron birth
spectrum, is that?

525
00:27:18,407 --> 00:27:20,240
MICHAEL SHORT: So the
neutron birth spectrum

526
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,280
is included in fission.

527
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,950
So our nu is in there.

528
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,480
Our chi of E is in there.

529
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,300
And that's a nu of E.
That's all accounted

530
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,440
for in the fission term.

531
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,813
And we'll see how we put
that together to math.

532
00:27:32,813 --> 00:27:34,730
And if no one else has
any ideas, that's good.

533
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,530
Because neither do I.

534
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,630
Now what about the lost terms?

535
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,700
There aren't too many
of these, as long

536
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,260
as you lump them correctly.

537
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,170
So what sort of
ways could neutrons

538
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:48,608
be lost from our energy group?

539
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,480
Yep?

540
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,910
AUDIENCE: Scatter out.

541
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,112
MICHAEL SHORT: Scatter out, yep.

542
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,700
They can undergo any kind
of scattering reaction.

543
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,220
And they will probably
change direction and energy.

544
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,920
What else?

545
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,080
Well, we've got to list up on
the board right there, right?

546
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:13,930
Capture, fission,
because in order

547
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:19,340
to undergo a vision you
actually have to lose a neutron,

548
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,810
and so on, and so on, and so on.

549
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:25,360
What I want to do to
simplify things is this.

550
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:33,130
It's a lot simpler just to
track the total cross-section,

551
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,930
the probability
of any interaction

552
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,570
at all whatsoever,
because any interaction

553
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:41,260
will cause the neutron to
either change energy and angle,

554
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,860
or disappear, even if it
makes some other ones.

555
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:49,830
So we can simplify this to just
the total cross-section term.

556
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,850
And there's only one
other way that neutrons

557
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:56,428
can leave our energy
angle and volume group.

558
00:28:56,428 --> 00:28:57,220
What would that be?

559
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,690
So any reaction takes
care of energy and angle.

560
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,902
What about volume?

561
00:29:06,902 --> 00:29:08,610
How do neutrons leave
the control volume?

562
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,740
It's simpler than it may sound.

563
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,820
They just go.

564
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,050
They just move.

565
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,990
The neutrons are
always moving, right?

566
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:19,990
We'll call that leakage.

567
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:30,380
Because every neutron's got a
speed, like we showed up here,

568
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,720
where the flux of
neutrons, the number

569
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,200
of neutrons moving through
some surface per second,

570
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,380
is just their velocity times
the number that are there.

571
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,880
For there to be a
neutron flux there

572
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,790
has to be a velocity, which
means the neutrons are moving.

573
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,670
So the neutrons, even without
undergoing any reaction,

574
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:49,353
could just move out
of our control volume.

575
00:29:49,353 --> 00:29:50,270
And then they're gone.

576
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:56,050
And that's all there is
for gain and loss terms.

577
00:29:56,050 --> 00:30:00,210
So let's see if we can
do this all on one board.

578
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:04,710
I want to start putting this
table right here into math

579
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:08,090
that we'll be able to abstract,
simplify, and then solve,

580
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:10,590
but not today, not solve today.

581
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,300
So if we want to
track the change

582
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:21,270
in the number of neutrons
as a function of time,

583
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:24,240
let's start writing
down the gain terms.

584
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,490
So how do we describe
the number of neutrons

585
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:30,012
produced from fission?

586
00:30:30,012 --> 00:30:31,720
What sort of terms do
we have to include?

587
00:30:35,027 --> 00:30:37,360
And Jared started kicking us
off, so what would you say?

588
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,940
AUDIENCE: Neutron birth?

589
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,030
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep, so the
neutron birth spectrum,

590
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:46,510
there's going to be some
probability that a neutron is

591
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:49,840
born in our energy
group E. Because we're

592
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,580
tracking how many neutrons are
in our little dE energy group.

593
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:59,320
What else matters
in terms of fission?

594
00:31:02,645 --> 00:31:04,550
AUDIENCE: Number of fissions?

595
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,270
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep,
number of fissions.

596
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,020
So if we want to write
number of fissions,

597
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,930
we have to write that
as a reaction rate.

598
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:13,910
So let's take those
two terms right there.

599
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:18,230
So we'll have sigma fission.

600
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:22,610
In this case, we're going
to write E-prime times flux

601
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:29,590
of r E-prime, omega-prime, t.

602
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,810
Why did I write E
and omega prime here?

603
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,930
Just from a physical reason.

604
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:37,110
Yeah?

605
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,950
AUDIENCE: So you're going to
be coming from another energy

606
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,870
group.

607
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,340
MICHAEL SHORT: Precisely.

608
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:41,910
That's right.

609
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:45,750
So the neutrons are going to be
produced from some other energy

610
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,500
group.

611
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,380
For example, the fission
birth spectrum right here

612
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,603
starts out--

613
00:31:50,603 --> 00:31:51,270
where did it go?

614
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:54,150
I knew I drew it
somewhere-- at one MeV.

615
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:57,420
But most of the neutrons
that cause fission to happen

616
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,210
are way down below 1 eV.

617
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,400
So it's different
energy neutrons

618
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,520
that cause neutrons to be
born in our energy group.

619
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,680
That's why we're using
E-prime and not E.

620
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,160
It's some other energy group.

621
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:16,810
And so we also have to account
for all possible other energy

622
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:17,502
groups.

623
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,210
So if we want to write
this, right, we'll

624
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:28,010
say this could be as low as
0 eV, to our maximum energy.

625
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:35,980
And there's going to be some
d-omega-prime, dE-prime, dV.

626
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:41,920
We'll also have to account
for all possible angles

627
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:47,770
and integrate over
our entire volume.

628
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,700
It's going to look ugly
quick, but it's all

629
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,860
going to be understandable.

630
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,360
So what this says
is that we have

631
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,360
to account for the
reaction rate of fission

632
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,650
from all other energy
neutrons inside our volume

633
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,660
from other energies
and other angles,

634
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,480
and account for every
other possible energy.

635
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,630
Because they can all
make fission happen.

636
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,000
What else is missing in terms
of describing the number

637
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,051
of neutrons made from fission?

638
00:33:14,051 --> 00:33:15,426
AUDIENCE: Neutron
multiplication.

639
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:17,009
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep,
there's the number

640
00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:18,940
of neutrons made per fission.

641
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:23,690
So we have to put in our
neutron multiplication factor.

642
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:26,040
And in this case, normalize--

643
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,910
I think someone had mentioned
solid angle-- we normalize over

644
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:32,570
all possible angles with
an over 4 pi in there.

645
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:35,460
And this right here
is the fission term.

646
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,490
So this tells us the
number of neutrons

647
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:40,460
gained in terms of
a reaction rate,

648
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:44,750
times the number of neutrons
for each of those reactions,

649
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,430
times the probability
that there just

650
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,140
happened to be born
in the energy group

651
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,900
that we're tracking.

652
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,380
So is there any term here
that's unclear to folks?

653
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,010
Yeah?

654
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:57,110
AUDIENCE: So what's the lower
bound on the first integral?

655
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,652
MICHAEL SHORT: On
the first integral?

656
00:33:58,652 --> 00:33:59,570
That 0 electron volts.

657
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,308
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

658
00:34:00,308 --> 00:34:01,850
MICHAEL SHORT:
Because supposedly you

659
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:04,490
could have a neutron
at 0 eV, which

660
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,380
has a very high cross-section.

661
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,750
So it should probably
induce fission.

662
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,929
In reality, there might be some
actual minimum temperature.

663
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:14,630
But there is a
non-zero probability

664
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,708
that you could have
a neutron at rest.

665
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:17,750
It's just not very large.

666
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,770
AUDIENCE: And the top bound?

667
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,728
MICHAEL SHORT: The top
bound as E max, whatever

668
00:34:20,728 --> 00:34:22,760
your maximum neutron energy is.

669
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:28,670
This is usually around 10 MeV,
for most fission reactors.

670
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:33,600
That E max is going to be this
point right here, the highest

671
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:38,750
energy at which neutrons
can be born by any process.

672
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,150
And so this term
right here is going

673
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:45,762
to serve as a template for all
the other gain and loss terms.

674
00:34:45,762 --> 00:34:47,679
So I think this is the
hardest one that we had

675
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,630
to develop from the beginning.

676
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:54,230
Now let's develop the
term for, let's just

677
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:57,030
go with external
sources, pretty easy.

678
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:00,065
There's going to be some
source making neutrons.

679
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,900
It's something that
you would just impose.

680
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,660
Like say, all right, I have a
californium source giving off

681
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,902
this many neutrons.

682
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:14,110
Well then you know how many
neutrons it's giving off.

683
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,070
And that one's done.

684
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,640
That's easy.

685
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,490
So we've done fission.

686
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,460
We've done external.

687
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:28,190
Now that we've done fission
let's tackle photo fission.

688
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,790
So what would be photo fission
cross-section look like?

689
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,293
It's going to look
awfully similar.

690
00:35:42,293 --> 00:35:43,710
So what sort of
things do you need

691
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,168
to know if it's a
fission reaction?

692
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,710
Well, what do we have up here?

693
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:52,960
Just start reading things off.

694
00:35:56,392 --> 00:35:57,100
I heard a murmur.

695
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:57,810
What was that?

696
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] flux.

697
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,760
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
so you're going

698
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,900
to have to have some flux.

699
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:07,310
In this case, we want to know
what's the flux of gamma rays

700
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:09,700
because photo fission
starts off with a gamma,

701
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,390
then ends up with a fission.

702
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:14,600
And it's also going
to be in our volume.

703
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,110
It's going to matter what the
energy of those gammas is.

704
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:22,250
They'll all be traveling in
some direction at some time.

705
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:25,330
What else do we need?

706
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,452
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the 4 pi [INAUDIBLE]..

707
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:28,910
MICHAEL SHORT:
Yeah, if we're going

708
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:34,010
to be going over all
angles, you need the 4 pi.

709
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:34,550
What else?

710
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:41,174
Do we have a reaction rate yet?

711
00:36:41,174 --> 00:36:42,020
AUDIENCE: No.

712
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,452
MICHAEL SHORT: No,
well what's missing?

713
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,323
AUDIENCE: The cross-section.

714
00:36:46,323 --> 00:36:47,490
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

715
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,280
We need a cross-section.

716
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,120
And in this case,
instead of just fission,

717
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,750
or neutron fission, we'll
put in the gamma fission

718
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,560
cross-section.

719
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,100
And so now we have a reaction
rate for a single reaction.

720
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,670
We've got to integrate
over all of our gamma ray

721
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:10,710
energies, over all
angles, over our volume.

722
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:26,780
What else is missing besides
our d-omega, dE gamma, d-Volume.

723
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,420
It should look awfully similar
because the terms are basically

724
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,743
exactly the same, with just
different cross sections

725
00:37:31,743 --> 00:37:32,660
and energies in there.

726
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,600
So what's missing between the
photo fission and the neutron

727
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,006
fission one?

728
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:38,697
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

729
00:37:38,697 --> 00:37:41,030
MICHAEL SHORT: Sure, there
might be some different birth

730
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,736
spectrum for gammas.

731
00:37:43,736 --> 00:37:45,800
And there might be some
different multiplication

732
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,570
factor for gammas between
neutron fission and photo

733
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:50,250
fission.

734
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,320
But these terms should
look exactly the same

735
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,350
because in every case you're
looking at some reaction

736
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:58,770
rate between either the neutrons
and fission or the gamma

737
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,150
and fission.

738
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,670
And you need to know at
what energy they're born,

739
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:05,640
how many are made,
all the angles,

740
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,600
and integrate overall the
variables that we care about.

741
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,920
And this is part of why I'm
adding these extra terms

742
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,800
because they end up looking
all exactly the same.

743
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,280
It's the integral of a
reaction rate times some stuff.

744
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,230
That's all that every single one
of these terms is going to be.

745
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,050
So we've got photo fission.

746
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:26,910
Now let's tackle in-scattering.

747
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,830
So how do we
represent scattering?

748
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:35,160
In the same way that we
represented fission, what do we

749
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,130
start with inside the integral?

750
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:39,130
AUDIENCE: Reaction rate?

751
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,900
MICHAEL SHORT:
Reaction rate, yes.

752
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,845
So we're going to have some
scattering cross-section.

753
00:38:44,845 --> 00:38:46,220
And if it's in
the scattering, it

754
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,710
means it's coming from a
different energy, hence

755
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,177
the prime.

756
00:38:50,177 --> 00:38:51,010
We'll have our flux.

757
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,830
And here's where we're going to
bring in our scattering kernel.

758
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:04,710
Because there's some
probability that the neutron

759
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,200
scatters in from
a different group.

760
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:21,505
And then we'll have our
d-omega, dE-prime, dV.

761
00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:22,380
Is this complete yet?

762
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:32,700
We've now accounted for
one other energy, E-prime.

763
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,300
Now how do we account for
all possible other energies

764
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,213
scattering into
our energy group?

765
00:39:37,213 --> 00:39:38,140
AUDIENCE: Integrals.

766
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,680
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep,
again, same integrals.

767
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:45,470
We integrate over all
possible energies,

768
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:51,190
over all possible angles,
and over our volume.

769
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,350
Hopefully these terms
are looking very similar.

770
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:57,820
In every case it's a volume,
angle, energy integral

771
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,365
of a reaction rate.

772
00:39:59,365 --> 00:40:01,990
And all that's saying is there's
some rate that these reactions

773
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:05,770
are occurring, which is either
a gain rate or a loss rate.

774
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,080
We integrate over whatever
volume, energy, and angle

775
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,800
we're tracking.

776
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,840
And that's all there is to it.

777
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,463
So we've got in-scattering.

778
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:20,722
Now let's tackle
the n,in reactions.

779
00:40:20,722 --> 00:40:22,680
There's only going to be
one little difference.

780
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,763
But I want you guys to
tell me what sort of things

781
00:40:24,763 --> 00:40:27,030
are going to be the same
as all the other terms

782
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,780
that we have here.

783
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,760
So what do we start off
with inside the integral?

784
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,760
AUDIENCE: Reaction rate.

785
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,052
MICHAEL SHORT: A reaction rate.

786
00:40:37,052 --> 00:40:38,610
And how do we write that?

787
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

788
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,505
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep,
a cross-section,

789
00:40:45,505 --> 00:40:47,130
there's going to be
some cross-section,

790
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:53,000
for, let's call it n,in reaction
as a function of energy,

791
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,710
times a flux.

792
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:02,970
There'll be our normal
integrated over all angles,

793
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:06,940
all energies, and our volume.

794
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,200
So we have a reaction rate.

795
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,290
What do we have to then
integrate that reaction right

796
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,910
over to get all the neutrons in?

797
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:19,850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
same things.

798
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:22,400
MICHAEL SHORT: Same things
as everything else, exactly.

799
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,050
Integrate over all
possible energies,

800
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,880
integrate over all
possible angles,

801
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,630
integrate over our volume,
looks quite similar.

802
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:36,260
The only thing we haven't dealt
with is this i term right here.

803
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:45,790
Because there can be, there are
actually n,2n reactions, n,3n,

804
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:49,560
n,4n, and so on.

805
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,070
So there are probabilities
that, let's say

806
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:55,130
you, in goes 1 neutron,
out comes 3 neutrons.

807
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,810
But no fission
actually happened.

808
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:58,760
You just blast a
few of them out.

809
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:04,775
So I think all we'd really have
to do is sum over i equals 1.

810
00:42:04,775 --> 00:42:07,715
Oh, I'm sorry, i equals
2, because a neutron

811
00:42:07,715 --> 00:42:09,590
going in and then the
same neutron going out,

812
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,000
that's just scattering.

813
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,050
And what would be the maximum?

814
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:17,440
Probably 4.

815
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,870
Because the probability
of an increasing i

816
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:24,400
or more neutrons coming out
gets lower and lower as you go.

817
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,640
In fact, these reactions
don't even turn on until--

818
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:32,260
the n,2n reaction turns
on and around like 1 MeV.

819
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:36,070
This one turns on and
around like 5 MeV.

820
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,930
This one turns on
at like 12 MeV.

821
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:42,410
I was just looking up these
cross-sections before class.

822
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:45,010
So if you have a reaction
that doesn't happen

823
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:47,410
beyond your highest
neutron energy,

824
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:49,655
you probably don't
need to worry about it.

825
00:42:49,655 --> 00:42:52,030
But the reason I had us write
all these extra equations--

826
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:55,510
and I think that the t-shirt
for this department needs some

827
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,830
updating to include
these extra terms--

828
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:00,100
is because they're
all the same term.

829
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,980
It is in every case,
it's an integral

830
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:13,860
over all of our stuff
of a reaction rate,

831
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:18,090
d-stuff, times a multiplier.

832
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:23,900
Every single term
in this equation

833
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,360
follows the exact same pattern.

834
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,870
So what I hope, and I would
expect out of you guys,

835
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:32,790
is that if I were to
give you this table

836
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,250
of possible reactions,
you would be

837
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:39,510
able to recreate this neutron
transport equation using

838
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:42,030
this template to know that
every single reaction is just

839
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:45,450
multiplier, times integral
of stuff of a reaction rate,

840
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:49,890
d-stuff, where the reaction rate
is just a cross-section times

841
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:51,450
a flux.

842
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:54,500
That's all there is to it.

843
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,450
Not bad when you see
that everything follows

844
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:58,740
the same pattern, right?

845
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,080
That's the basis behind most
of the hideous equations

846
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,940
that you see in all
of physics everywhere,

847
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,700
is if there are additive
or subtractive terms,

848
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,363
they'd better be
in the same units.

849
00:44:07,363 --> 00:44:09,030
And so they're going
to follow some sort

850
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:11,430
of a similar template.

851
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:14,380
Not too scary when you
think of it that way.

852
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,335
So let's now come up
with the loss terms.

853
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:22,650
I should have planned
these boards better.

854
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:25,350
Keep these ones here
so we keep a template.

855
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:28,890
And we'll have a
minus, well, how

856
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:35,770
do we write the anything
reaction using this template?

857
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,250
How many neutrons
undergo a reaction

858
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,000
when one neutron
undergoes a reaction?

859
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:48,982
Yeah, 1.

860
00:44:48,982 --> 00:44:49,940
So our multiplier is 1.

861
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,630
We don't have to worry about it.

862
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:53,440
We have our integral of stuff.

863
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,190
So we'll have to integrate over
all possible volumes, angles,

864
00:44:58,190 --> 00:44:59,540
and energy.

865
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,485
And what's on the inside?

866
00:45:02,485 --> 00:45:05,300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
total cross-section.

867
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:09,220
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep,
total cross-section

868
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:22,460
as a function of energy times
the flux, d-stuff to save time.

869
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:25,100
So don't worry, even though
the boards are laid out funny,

870
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,933
on the pictures of the
blackboard that we'll

871
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:29,308
put on the Stellar site, I'll
Photoshop these and arrange

872
00:45:29,308 --> 00:45:30,850
them so that they're
all in sequence.

873
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:32,180
And you can see everything.

874
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:35,390
And then there's the
last term to account for.

875
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:37,540
That's the leakage term.

876
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,200
This one is a little different.

877
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,970
It's the only one that's
a little different.

878
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:46,750
And in this case, we're going
to say that our little volume

879
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:53,140
element also has
a surface to it.

880
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:57,480
And if the neutrons
leave the surface,

881
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,470
then they leave the volume.

882
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:05,770
So in this case, we'll have a
surface integral of our neutron

883
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:10,860
flux, say our neutron flux dS.

884
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:14,160
Because there's no reaction
happening when neutrons just

885
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,840
move, right.

886
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,520
They just go.

887
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:23,652
And so, well, we'd also have to
multiply by our normal vector.

888
00:46:23,652 --> 00:46:25,110
Because every flux
is going to have

889
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:28,210
a certain number of neutrons
moving in a certain direction.

890
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:31,860
Let's say we were tracking
the flow of neutrons

891
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,310
through this surface right here.

892
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:42,830
And if we had a flux going
in exactly this direction,

893
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:47,600
through this surface, and
this is the normal vector,

894
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:52,800
in this case, flux,
which is a vector

895
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,950
dotted with the normal
vector, is just the flux.

896
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:58,200
Which is to say that if the
flux and the normal vector

897
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,080
are aligned in the same way,
then every neutron going

898
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:04,740
through the surface is tracked
as going through the surface.

899
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:08,760
To take the opposite example,
what about the situation where

900
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:15,120
you have a surface here and you
have a mono-directional flux

901
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,340
of neutrons in this direction.

902
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,320
And that is your surface normal.

903
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:28,510
What does the flux dotted
with the surface normal vector

904
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,280
equal?

905
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:35,840
0, it's just a dot product
between the direction

906
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,410
that your neutrons are moving
and the normal vector saying,

907
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:41,390
does it go out of
the surface at all?

908
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:45,990
So for these two limiting cases,
in this case, the fluxes just

909
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:47,540
let's say, what
is it, the number

910
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,820
of neutrons leaving the
surface is the flux.

911
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:51,830
In this case, no neutrons
leave the surface

912
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:54,680
because they're not actually
going through the surface.

913
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:58,820
It's a good time to mention,
again, that these units of flux

914
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:03,590
are in neutrons per centimeter
squared per second, which

915
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:05,690
is to say the number
of particles traveling

916
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:09,655
through this area in centimeter
squared every second.

917
00:48:09,655 --> 00:48:11,030
I know we've gone
over it before,

918
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:13,622
but I want you to keep
these units in mind.

919
00:48:13,622 --> 00:48:15,830
Because now they actually
have a little more physical

920
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:18,010
significance.

921
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:22,590
And that's why we have this
flux times normal vector dS.

922
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:24,210
That describes the
number of neutrons

923
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:26,050
that get through the surface.

924
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:30,730
The last thing we'll do, because
everything else is a volume

925
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:33,850
integral, we want this to be a
volume integral because we're

926
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:35,710
going to simplify this
in terms of getting

927
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:37,157
rid of all the volume stuff.

928
00:48:37,157 --> 00:48:39,490
We're going to use what's
called the divergence theorem.

929
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,810
I hear some snickering.

930
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:46,340
Because I remember
this is probably

931
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,080
something where you were told
in 1801 or 1802, this exists.

932
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,230
Use it in a few problems.

933
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:52,190
Moving on.

934
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:53,965
That sound about right?

935
00:48:53,965 --> 00:48:55,340
This is when you
actually use it.

936
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,110
So the divergence theorem
says that the integral

937
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:07,310
of some variable F dS, through
some volume element of surface,

938
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:11,970
is the same as the
volume integral of--

939
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:12,800
how does this go--

940
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:19,160
del dot F dV.

941
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,060
And this is going to be
quite important because one,

942
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:25,370
it gives us a volume integral.

943
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:33,630
So this is, it will be a volume
integral of our del dot flux

944
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:36,940
dV, so now everything's
in the same units.

945
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:40,330
And if we were to say forget
about our little volume

946
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:40,830
element.

947
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:43,230
Let's just assume
an infinite reactor.

948
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:47,070
Every single volume integral in
term just instantly disappears.

949
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:49,650
Because we wrote
these equations to be

950
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:55,080
identical for any dV
anywhere inside this reactor.

951
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:59,340
If the reactor is then infinite,
then all of those volume terms

952
00:49:59,340 --> 00:49:59,952
disappear.

953
00:49:59,952 --> 00:50:01,410
And that's the
first simplification

954
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:05,030
that we'll make
in the next class.

955
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:09,380
But right here on
these five boards,

956
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,610
we've developed the
neutron transport equation,

957
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:15,140
which is the absolute, most
general, highest escalated

958
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,390
form of how do
you track neutrons

959
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:21,560
through any volume, any
direction, any energy,

960
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,060
at any time.

961
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,850
And we'll spend Thursday
and Friday simplifying this

962
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:28,190
to something that we can solve.

963
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:32,040
The other reason that we
use this divergence theorem

964
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,040
is because we're going
to make an approximation.

965
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,440
This crazy looking
thing right here,

966
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,570
we will make an approximation
called the diffusion

967
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:40,940
approximation where we
assume that neutrons

968
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:43,580
are like a gas that just
diffuse away from each other.

969
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:46,910
And that's going to make solving
this really, really easy.

970
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:48,650
It's going to go from
some second order

971
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:51,740
differential or differential
integral equation

972
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:55,090
to just the equation that
you can solve with algebra.

973
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:56,190
Yep?

974
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:59,470
AUDIENCE: Do you need the dE
d-omega for the last term?

975
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:05,470
MICHAEL SHORT: Probably, yeah,
over all E, over all omega.

976
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:12,280
And that flux is going
to be of r, E omega, t.

977
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:16,755
Absolutely.

978
00:51:16,755 --> 00:51:18,880
Just to make sure, everything
is in the same units,

979
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,610
every term has a fairly
similar template.

980
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:26,260
The only difference is leakage,
there's no reaction here.

981
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:32,940
Every single other term
constitutes a reaction.

982
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,650
And they all follow
this template.

983
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,750
So I will stop here
because it is five of.

984
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,350
See if anyone has
any quick questions

985
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:42,980
on what you've got here.

986
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:46,180
I'll make sure to get all
of this on the board images

987
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,950
so you guys can
take a look at it.

988
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:49,450
And I'll projected
up on the screen

989
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:51,700
so that we can make some
simplifications based on what

990
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:54,440
we see here on Thursday.

991
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,070
Yeah?

992
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,582
AUDIENCE: What is the
neutron birth spectrum?

993
00:51:57,582 --> 00:51:59,290
MICHAEL SHORT: The
neutron birth spectrum

994
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:01,900
says that if you have any
old fission event, what's

995
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,000
the probability of
those neutrons being

996
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,080
born at different energies?

997
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:09,250
What this says is that they're
born between 1 and 10 MeV,

998
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,342
with a peak at around 2 MeV.

999
00:52:11,342 --> 00:52:13,300
But if you want to track
the number of neutrons

1000
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,675
in every energy group, you
need to know where they begin.

1001
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:19,620
Good question.

1002
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:22,823
So if any of the terms here are
unclear what they physically

1003
00:52:22,823 --> 00:52:24,990
mean, because that's what
I'm most interested in you

1004
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:28,020
guys knowing, please do
ask either on Piazza,

1005
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,620
on email, on Thursday.

1006
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:30,120
Yeah?

1007
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:30,810
AUDIENCE: What's the
difference between the big N

1008
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:32,610
and the little n again?

1009
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:35,490
MICHAEL SHORT: The big N
and the little n, which one?

1010
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:38,054
The cursive one, or this one?

1011
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:40,350
AUDIENCE: The little n
up top there and then

1012
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:41,340
the non-cursive one.

1013
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:44,220
MICHAEL SHORT: OK, the little
n and the non-cursive one.

1014
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:47,700
The little n is the number
of neutrons in a volume,

1015
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:51,290
at a certain energy, going in
a direction, at a certain time.

1016
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:54,270
Big N right here is just
number density, number

1017
00:52:54,270 --> 00:53:01,030
of atoms per centimeter cubed.

1018
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:04,210
Cursive n is the number
of neutrons at an energy,

1019
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:05,020
in a volume.

1020
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:07,270
We don't care where
they're going.

1021
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:10,870
And the reason I write
these terms up here is we

1022
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:13,750
are going to switch from
lowercase to capital,

1023
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:16,480
or angularly-dependent
to angularly-independent

1024
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,290
by making a simple
approximation to say,

1025
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:20,082
we don't care what
direction they're going.

1026
00:53:20,082 --> 00:53:22,560
We just care if they're there.

1027
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,027
But in real complex
neutron physics problems,

1028
00:53:25,027 --> 00:53:27,360
like the one solved at the
computational reactor physics

1029
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,670
group, you need to
know all the angles.

1030
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:31,170
And you need to
know the probability

1031
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:33,960
or the cross-section that a
neutron coming in at this angle

1032
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,230
leaves at that angle and
imparts a certain energy.

1033
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:37,480
Because they're all different.

1034
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,450
For the purposes of
this class, I just

1035
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,252
want you to know
that they exist.

1036
00:53:41,252 --> 00:53:43,460
And the first thing we will
do is simplify them away.

1037
00:53:45,717 --> 00:53:47,300
But this way, you'll
be fully prepared

1038
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,730
for 22.05 and a lifetime
of reactor physics,

1039
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:50,540
if you so choose.

1040
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,580
Who here is done a year op
in the computational reactor

1041
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:56,690
physics group?

1042
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:58,186
Just one, OK.

1043
00:53:58,186 --> 00:53:59,033
I recommend more.

1044
00:53:59,033 --> 00:54:01,200
They tend to be the biggest
group in the department.

1045
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,930
They've got like
20 grad students

1046
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:05,880
and probably more
year ops than that.

1047
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,310
So try it out.

1048
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:10,430
It's what makes us
us, us nukes, right,

1049
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:16,400
is neutrons and tracking them
to ridiculous proportions.

1050
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,350
OK, definitely want to let
you guys go it's one of.

1051
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:21,461
So I'll see you all on Thursday.
