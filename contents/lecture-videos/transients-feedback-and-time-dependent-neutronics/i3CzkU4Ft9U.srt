8
00:00:22,597 --> 00:00:25,180
MICHAEL SHORT: So today is going
to be the last day of neutron

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:25,630
physics.

10
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,422
As promised, we're
going to talk about what

11
00:00:27,422 --> 00:00:30,520
happens as a function of time
when you perturb the reactor,

12
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,619
like you all did
about a month ago.

13
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,410
Did any of you guys notice
the old-fashioned analog panel

14
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,710
meter that said, reactor period,
when you were doing your power

15
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,460
manipulations?

16
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,750
We're going to do that today.

17
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,792
And you're going to explore
that on the homework.

18
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,790
So I'm arranging for all of
your actual power manipulation

19
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,240
traces to be sent to you.

20
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,005
So each one, you'll have
your own reactor data.

21
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:51,880
You'll be able to describe
the reactor period

22
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,200
and see how well it fits our
infinite medium single group

23
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,330
equations, which it turns
out is not very well.

24
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,670
But that's OK, because you'll
get to explain the differences.

25
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,760
First, before we
get into transients

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,130
I wanted to talk a bit about
criticality and perturbing it.

27
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,135
So let's say we had our old
single group kit criticality

28
00:01:13,135 --> 00:01:13,635
relation.

29
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,510
And I'd like to analyze,
just intuitively or mentally

30
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,100
with you guys, a few
different situations.

31
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,910
Let's say we're talking
about a light water

32
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:37,180
reactor or a thermal reactor,
like the MIT reactor, or pretty

33
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,470
much all the reactors
we have in this country.

34
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,830
What sort of things could
you do to perturb it?

35
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,430
And how would that
affect criticality?

36
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,800
For example, let's say you
shoved in a control rod.

37
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,530
Let's take the
simplest scenario.

38
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,670
Control rods in.

39
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,600
What would happen
to each of the terms

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,950
in the criticality condition?

41
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,860
And then, what would
happen to k effective?

42
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,450
So let's just go one by one.

43
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,479
Does nu ever change, ever?

44
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,280
Actually, yeah, it does.

45
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,638
Over time, you'll start--

46
00:02:14,638 --> 00:02:16,180
that nu right there,
remember, that's

47
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,120
a nu bar, number of neutrons
produced per fission.

48
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:27,040
As you start to consume
U238 add neutrons.

49
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,370
And as you guys saw through
a complicated chain of events

50
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,100
on the exam, eventually
make plutonium 239,

51
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,370
which is a fissile fuel.

52
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:42,380
The nu for 238 is actually
different than the nu for 239.

53
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,137
So I don't want to say
that nu never changes.

54
00:02:45,137 --> 00:02:47,470
It's just that shoving the
control rods into the reactor

55
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,300
is not going to change nu.

56
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,050
But it does change slowly over
time as you build up plutonium.

57
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,660
What about sigma fission?

58
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,330
If this were a blended
homogeneous reactor

59
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,340
or a reactor in a blender, what
would happen to sigma fission

60
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,010
as you then shove in
an absorbing material?

61
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,210
Does it change?

62
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,140
AUDIENCE: No.

63
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,370
MICHAEL SHORT: You say, no.

64
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,580
And I'm going to add
here homogeneous.

65
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,730
So in this case, remember if
we define the average sigma

66
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,920
fission as a sum--

67
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,210
I'll add bits to it--

68
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,230
of each material's volume
fraction, or let's say

69
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:45,490
atomic fraction, times each
material's sigma fission,

70
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,010
if we throw nu materials
into the reactor,

71
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,780
then this homogeneous
sigma fission

72
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,420
does change when
we put materials in

73
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,360
or take materials out.

74
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,260
So you guys want to
revise your idea?

75
00:03:59,260 --> 00:03:59,950
AUDIENCE: Yes.

76
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,750
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes, thank you.

77
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,000
There's only one other choice.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,770
Now the question
is, by how much?

79
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,370
If you put in a control rod
where let's say the control

80
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:14,200
rod's sigma fission
would be equal to zero,

81
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,430
but volume would
be equal to small.

82
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,373
Can't be any more
specific than that.

83
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:21,790
How much of an
effect do you think

84
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,960
you'll have on sigma fission?

85
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,137
AUDIENCE: Small.

86
00:04:25,137 --> 00:04:26,220
MICHAEL SHORT: Very small.

87
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,560
So let's say a little
down arrow like that.

88
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,320
What about sigma absorption?

89
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,950
The volume is still small, but a
control rod by definition sigma

90
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,480
absorption equals huge.

91
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,195
So what do you think?

92
00:04:44,195 --> 00:04:45,570
AUDIENCE: It's
going to increase.

93
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,950
MICHAEL SHORT: It's going to
increase a little or a lot?

94
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,420
AUDIENCE: A lot.

95
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,790
MICHAEL SHORT: Quite a bit.

96
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,370
Now let's look at the
diffusion constant.

97
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,200
And remember that the diffusion
constant is 1 over 3 sigma

98
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,990
total, minus the average
cosine scattering angle

99
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,230
sigma scattering.

100
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,080
What do you think is going to
happen to the neutron diffusion

101
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,020
coefficient as you throw
in an absorbing material?

102
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,580
Something that's got an enormous
absorption cross-section

103
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:29,240
is also going to have an
enormous total cross-section,

104
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,160
because sigma total is
sigma absorption plus sigma

105
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,710
scattering.

106
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,750
And sigma scattering
doesn't change that much.

107
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,100
But if sigma absorption goes
up, sigma total goes up.

108
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,160
If sigma total goes
up, then what happens

109
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,793
o the diffusion coefficient?

110
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:51,740
AUDIENCE: Decrease.

111
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,407
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep,
it's got a decrease.

112
00:05:57,675 --> 00:06:00,050
And how does inserting a
control rod change the geometry?

113
00:06:02,665 --> 00:06:04,520
AUDIENCE: It doesn't.

114
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,728
MICHAEL SHORT: Very, very close.

115
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:07,520
Yeah, you're right.

116
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,700
The control rod better
not change the geometry,

117
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,890
but what I do want
to remind you of is

118
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,940
that this buckling term
includes-- let's say,

119
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,420
this was a one
dimensional infinite slab

120
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,365
Cartesian reactor.

121
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,425
That little hot over there
means we have some extrapolation

122
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:31,925
distance.

123
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,040
Remember, if we were to
draw our infinite reactor

124
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,320
with the thickness
A and we wanted

125
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,180
to draw a flux profile
on top of that,

126
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,090
it would have to be
symmetric about the middle.

127
00:06:54,090 --> 00:07:01,200
And let's say we had our axis
of this is x and this is flux.

128
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,470
Flux can't go to zero right
at the edge of the reactor,

129
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,800
because that would mean that
no neutrons were literally

130
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,890
leaking out.

131
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,370
So there's going to be
some small extrapolation

132
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,580
distance equal to
about two times

133
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,890
the diffusion coefficient.

134
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,590
So the geometric
buckling is actually

135
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:24,820
pi over the reactor
geometry, plus 2 times

136
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,980
the diffusion coefficient.

137
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,360
And if the diffusion
coefficient goes down,

138
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,940
but it's also very,
very small compared

139
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,290
to the geometric buckling, how
much does the buckling change

140
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,740
and by how much?

141
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,685
And in what direction?

142
00:07:40,685 --> 00:07:42,227
AUDIENCE: It increases
very slightly.

143
00:07:42,227 --> 00:07:45,070
MICHAEL SHORT:
Increases very slightly.

144
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,370
So the buckling might
increase very slightly.

145
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,043
What's the overall net
effect on k effective?

146
00:07:52,043 --> 00:07:53,893
AUDIENCE: It goes down.

147
00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:55,810
MICHAEL SHORT: Should
go down, you would hope.

148
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,640
If you put a control
rod in, it should

149
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,350
make k effective go
down, because there's

150
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,377
a little decrease here.

151
00:08:02,377 --> 00:08:03,710
Things kind of cancel out there.

152
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:08,050
But the big one is putting
an absorption material,

153
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,283
like a control rod in, should
make k effective go down.

154
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,700
And that's the
most intuitive one,

155
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,520
but you can work out one
term at a time what's

156
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,560
generally going to happen.

157
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,670
So let's now look at
some other scenarios

158
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,811
for the same
criticality condition.

159
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,650
I'll just rewrite it so that
we can mess it all up again.

160
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:46,900
Now we want to go for the case
of boil or void your coolant.

161
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,450
And now we're getting into the
concept of different feedback

162
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,200
mechanisms.

163
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,720
We've already talked
once about how

164
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,280
raising the temperature
of something

165
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,620
tends to increase
cross-sections in certain ways.

166
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,120
But now let's say,
what would happen

167
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,680
if you boil your coolant?

168
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,950
If things got really hot and
the water started to boil.

169
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,515
What do you want to
happen to k effective?

170
00:09:12,515 --> 00:09:13,515
You want it to increase?

171
00:09:13,515 --> 00:09:14,190
AUDIENCE: Decrease.

172
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,648
MICHAEL SHORT:
Decrease, thank you.

173
00:09:15,648 --> 00:09:17,970
You want it to decrease, or
else you'd get a Chernobyl.

174
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,750
And we'll talk about how that
happened in a week or two.

175
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,240
So now let's reason
through each one of these.

176
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,350
Let's assume that
nu doesn't change

177
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,120
when you boil the coolant.

178
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,955
What about sigma fission
of the whole reactor?

179
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,190
You're taking a little bit of
material out of the reactor

180
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,440
by taking liquid water,
which is fairly dense,

181
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,950
and making it gaseous
water, which is less dense.

182
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:55,270
So overall, there are more
fissile atoms in the reactor

183
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,640
proportionately when the
coolant is boiled away

184
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,000
than when it's not.

185
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,870
So what happens
to sigma fission?

186
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,290
The average sigma
fission for the reactor

187
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,020
will go up ever so slightly.

188
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,820
Probably not enough to matter.

189
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,010
What about sigma absorption?

190
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,210
If the coolant disappears.

191
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,910
AUDIENCE: It goes down.

192
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,310
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
water is an absorber.

193
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,130
Hydrogen and oxygen--
really just hydrogen--

194
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:31,940
have some pretty non-negligible
absorption coefficients.

195
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,510
And if those go
away, then you're

196
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,917
losing a bit of
absorber, aren't you?

197
00:10:38,917 --> 00:10:40,000
Actually it's interesting.

198
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,620
Oxygen is the lowest thermal
cross-section of any element.

199
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,010
So we can treat it as
pretty much transparent.

200
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,770
Now how about the
diffusion coefficient?

201
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,380
We've got the formula
for it up there.

202
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,170
If all of a sudden
your neutrons don't

203
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,590
have much to moderate from--

204
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,430
there's not much to
moderate your neutrons.

205
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:00,660
Yeah.

206
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,410
AUDIENCE: Your scattering
just disappears.

207
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:06,560
MICHAEL SHORT: Your scattering
just disappears, right?

208
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,140
But so does some of your
total cross-section.

209
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,790
So chances are,
those neutrons are

210
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,000
going to go farther before
they undergo any given

211
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,720
collision because there's
no water in the way.

212
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,470
So you'd expect neutron
diffusion to go up.

213
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,940
And what about
geometric buckling?

214
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:31,350
Diffusion goes up, then
the geometric buckling--

215
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,830
I'm just going to
make it really small.

216
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:38,960
But the net effect here, once
again, k effective goes down.

217
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,240
We didn't talk about anything to
do with the actual temperature

218
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,490
effects on the cross-sections.

219
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,950
This is just a density
thing on the coolant itself.

220
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,100
So let's now look at that.

221
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,560
What about if you
have some power spike,

222
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,840
raised fuel temperature?

223
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,330
I'll write it again, so
we can mess it up again.

224
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,930
So let's say you raise
the fuel temperature.

225
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,330
And that's going to cause
every cross-section effectively

226
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,840
to increase if you're doing
this average scenario.

227
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,280
Let's talk a little
bit about why.

228
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,960
It's not as simple
as just saying,

229
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,030
the cross-sections go up.

230
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,580
So let's say we had two
different temperatures,

231
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,980
cold and hot.

232
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,430
So this would be your
sigma fission cold.

233
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:39,150
And this would be your
sigma fission hot.

234
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:44,250
For cold, sigma fission
looks something like that.

235
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,380
And as the temperature
goes up, these

236
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,110
resonances, which I'll
just label right here--

237
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,690
resonances being
specific energy is

238
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,120
where the absorption suddenly
goes up, suddenly goes

239
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,170
down will actually
decrease in height.

240
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:06,950
But they'll start
to spread out more.

241
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:10,310
That's about as well as I
can draw it very crudely.

242
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:14,870
And same thing goes not
just for sigma fission,

243
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,920
but for sigma anything,
including absorption, including

244
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,790
total whatever you want.

245
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,510
And so if your goal is
to get your neutrons

246
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,910
from the fast
region where they're

247
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:30,890
born into the thermal region
where you get fission,

248
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,160
broadening these cross-sections
makes it more likely

249
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,890
that if the neutron loses
any amount of energy,

250
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:40,160
it's going to hit one of
these big resonance regions

251
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,330
and get absorbed or taken
away before it gets a chance

252
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,920
to go to the fission region.

253
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,420
So what this is
really going to do--

254
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,800
it's kind of funny to say
it in terms of a one group

255
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,610
criticality relation, but
your fission cross-section

256
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,250
is actually going to go down.

257
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,580
One reason is that the fuel
physically spreads out.

258
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,520
And so just from the
density modification,

259
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,550
you're not going to get as much.

260
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,230
But then you've
also got that effect

261
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:14,690
of increasing fission from these
resonance regions spreading

262
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,440
out.

263
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,990
The question is, which
one is a bigger effect?

264
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,930
Can't answer that with
a simple statement.

265
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,920
You'll go over a lot
more of that in 22.05

266
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,610
when you talk about what
actually defines a resonance

267
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,290
region, how do you
calculate them,

268
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:30,680
and how do they Doppler broaden
or broaden with temperature.

269
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,390
How about sigma absorption?

270
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,278
AUDIENCE: It goes down.

271
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:38,070
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
sigma absorption, it's

272
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,770
going to go down because
things spread out.

273
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:45,930
But it might also go up because
the cross-sections spread out,

274
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,405
or the resonances spread out.

275
00:14:47,405 --> 00:14:49,530
What's really going to
happen though is the reactor

276
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,200
atoms are effectively
spreading themselves apart.

277
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,915
The coolant's less dense.

278
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:56,040
The structural materials
in the fuel and everything

279
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,042
are still there.

280
00:14:57,042 --> 00:14:58,500
They're less dense,
but there's not

281
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,120
fewer of them in the reactor.

282
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,560
But there is going to be
less coolant in the reactor,

283
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,750
because it has the
ability to sparsify or get

284
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,730
less dense, and kind of
squeeze out the inlet

285
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,128
and outlet of the reactor.

286
00:15:10,128 --> 00:15:11,670
So what's really
going to happen here

287
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,680
is, we know diffusion
is going to go up,

288
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,280
which might cause a
corresponding change

289
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,540
in buckling.

290
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:22,610
And the net effect,
as we would hope,

291
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,135
k effective would go down.

292
00:15:25,135 --> 00:15:26,760
And so what we've
talked about now here

293
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,340
is directly
controlling reactivity

294
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,910
with control rods, what's
called a void coefficient,

295
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,430
where you actually want to have
a negative void coefficient.

296
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,910
So if you boil your
coolant too much,

297
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,310
k effective should go down.

298
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:42,210
And that's one of the
mechanisms that a light water

299
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:45,290
or a thermal reactor can
help stabilize itself.

300
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,540
And you can see that now from
just a really simplified one

301
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,557
group criticality relation.

302
00:15:51,557 --> 00:15:53,140
And if you raise the
fuel temperature,

303
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,290
let's say the fuel gets
really hot because there's

304
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,360
been some power
spike, you also want

305
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,330
the reactor to shut itself down,
which you can see that it does.

306
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,380
Let's make things
a little trickier.

307
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,060
Let's now talk about
a sodium reactor.

308
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,470
Fast reactor.

309
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:29,710
This one relies a lot more
on fast fission of U238.

310
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:36,120
So if we were to draw the two
cross-sections of 235 sigma

311
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,980
fission and 238 sigma fission--

312
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,200
remember, uranium 235
looked like the one

313
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:52,030
that we drew before, whereas
U238 goes something like that,

314
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,190
with no actual scale given.

315
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,350
I'm not going to even go there.

316
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,430
But uranium 238 does not need
moderation for the neutrons

317
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,860
to induce more fission.

318
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:07,329
So let's now write the same
criticality reaction, which,

319
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:10,470
again, is a super simplified
view of things, but that's OK.

320
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,319
What would happen to each
of these terms in a sodium

321
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,319
fast reactor if you
void the coolant?

322
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,588
So nu won't change.

323
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:33,630
What about sigma fission?

324
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,300
Well, if the coolant goes
away, then on average

325
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,210
there is fissile
materials contributing

326
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,870
more to that cross-section,
but not that much.

327
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:52,120
So if you want to
get technical, might

328
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,900
be the slightest of increases,
but doesn't matter that much.

329
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,240
What really matters, though,
is the stuff on the bottom.

330
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,660
Sodium does have a low, but
non-negligible absorption

331
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,230
cross-section.

332
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,410
So if the sodium
were to boil away,

333
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:12,290
then the absorption
would go down

334
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:15,510
by a non-negligible amount.

335
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,480
And then what about diffusion?

336
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:28,260
Well, we've got the
formula for it up there.

337
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,720
If there's not as much
coolant in the way,

338
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,230
then the neutrons
are going to be

339
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,880
able to get further on average.

340
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,047
Let's say, they're not going
to be scattering around

341
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,250
with as much of the sodium.

342
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,360
So there might be a small
increase in diffusion

343
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,090
and corresponding small
increase in buckling.

344
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:54,190
But this is where the
one group kind of fails.

345
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,990
What the sodium
is actually doing

346
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:59,080
is providing a little
bit of moderation,

347
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,740
so that some of those neutrons
when they bounce off of sodium

348
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,030
leave the fast fission
region and get absorbed.

349
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,360
And that's part of the
balance of the reactor.

350
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,060
If all of the neutrons
are then born fast

351
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,100
and don't really slow down
and just get absorbed,

352
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:20,140
then you might have an overall
positive void coefficient.

353
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,720
So this would tell you that
in a fast reactor where you're

354
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,670
depending on your
coolant not just to cool

355
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,580
the reactor, but
to absorb somewhat

356
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,310
and to moderate
somewhat, you don't

357
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:33,450
want to boil the coolant
in a fast reactor.

358
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,860
And is a lot of the reason
why most fast reactor

359
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,950
coolants tend to have
extremely high boiling points.

360
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,850
Sodium is approximately
893 Celsius.

361
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:47,350
Lead bismuth is
approximately 1,670 Celsius.

362
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,240
Molten salt, about
1,400 Celsius.

363
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,337
So all those coolant,
except for the sodium one,

364
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:55,420
you'll melt the steel that
the reactor is made out

365
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,370
of before your boil the coolant.

366
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,700
So boiling the coolant is a
bad day in a fast reactor,

367
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,340
because then things will
go from bad to worse,

368
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,270
because in this case, the
feedback coefficient can

369
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,750
be positive for
voiding the coolant.

370
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,990
That's no good.

371
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,793
So you want to keep
the reactor submerged.

372
00:20:13,793 --> 00:20:16,210
And that's another reason why
a lot of these fast reactors

373
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,460
are what's called,
pool-type reactors.

374
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,230
The reactor is not a
vessel with a bunch

375
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:23,350
of piping under it that
can break and fail,

376
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:29,500
but instead it's designed as
a huge pool of liquid sodium.

377
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,030
And then the core is somewhere
in here with a bunch of pumps

378
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:38,230
sending the coolant in and
back out, or through some heat

379
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,830
exchange or something.

380
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,100
So there's not really
any penetrations

381
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,810
on the bottom up this pool.

382
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,300
And you make sure
that you maintain,

383
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,230
either when you have
sodium or lead bismuth

384
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:54,640
eutectic, or liquid lead,
or some other fast reactor

385
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,792
coolant.

386
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:58,750
So these are some kind
of interesting scenarios

387
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,390
to think about.

388
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,930
I think one of them that
I put in the homework was

389
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,030
imagine you have the
MIT reactor and replace

390
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,250
the coolant with molten sodium.

391
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,810
What's going to happen?

392
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,880
Well, let's say you got
all the water out first

393
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,010
and it wouldn't just blow up.

394
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,538
What would actually happen
to the criticality relation?

395
00:21:14,538 --> 00:21:16,330
That's something I want
you to think about,

396
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,288
because one of the big
problems on the homework

397
00:21:18,288 --> 00:21:20,410
is doing exactly
this for scenarios

398
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:23,167
that have happened
to the MIT reactor,

399
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:24,250
except for the sodium one.

400
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,500
That's never happened
and hopefully never will.

401
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,010
I can't even imagine.

402
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,760
But now let's talk a
little bit about when

403
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,910
you perturb a reactor by
doing something to it,

404
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,130
putting the control rods
in, or pulling them out,

405
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,750
or doing whatever you want.

406
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,750
You're by definition
going to take

407
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:49,830
one of our first assumptions
about how the neutron diffusion

408
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,860
equation works and
throw it out the window.

409
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,575
So we're now moving into
the transient regime.

410
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,100
So to study what happens
in a reactor transient

411
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,770
or when something changes
as a function of time,

412
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:11,700
let's first go from k effective
to what we call k infinity.

413
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:17,183
The multiplication factor
for an infinite medium.

414
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:18,600
We're only doing
this because it's

415
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,370
analytically easier
to understand

416
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,480
and still gets the point across.

417
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,980
So we'll say that our
k infinity is still

418
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,868
a balance between
production and destruction.

419
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,020
The difference is if we
have an infinite medium,

420
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,540
there's no leakage.

421
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,030
You can't leak out of an
infinitely sized reactor,

422
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,980
should one ever exist.

423
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,090
And so it just comes
out as nu sigma fission

424
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,800
over sigma absorption.

425
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,270
A much simpler form.

426
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,400
And so now we can
write what would

427
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:59,540
happen to the flux in the
reactor as a function of time.

428
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,680
In this case, it's going
to be one over velocity.

429
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:06,920
I'm going to make this a very
obvious wide v. That change

430
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,830
in the reactor flux is going
to just be proportional

431
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,790
to the imbalance now in the
number of neutrons produced

432
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,110
and destroyed.

433
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,520
So the number of
neutrons produced

434
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,350
will be proportional
to very sharp nu sigma

435
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,410
fission minus the number
of neutrons destroyed,

436
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:29,310
sigma absorption, times
phi is a function of t.

437
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,270
Y'all with me so far?

438
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:38,500
So this right here
is a change, which

439
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:46,470
is proportional to an
imbalance between production

440
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:49,830
and destruction, times
the actual flux that you

441
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,750
have in some given time.

442
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,710
So to make this simpler,
let's multiply everything

443
00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:01,520
by v. Where's my green
substitute color?

444
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,390
Multiply everything by v.
And the only unfortunate

445
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,980
situation is we have a v
and a nu next to each other.

446
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,390
I'm going to try to keep them
looking really different.

447
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,290
Those go away.

448
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:23,500
And then we end up with,
if we divide by phi,

449
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,170
then those phi's go away.

450
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:36,460
And we have phi prime over
phi, equals v nu sigma fission,

451
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:41,410
minus v sigma absorption.

452
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,030
And now we can start
to define things

453
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:45,730
in terms of our
k infinity factor

454
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:49,060
and a new quantity
I'd like to introduce

455
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:53,080
called the prompt lifetime.

456
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,910
It's a measure of how long a
given neutron tends to live

457
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,290
before something happens to it.

458
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,620
Before it's either absorbed
or leaks out, well, not

459
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,580
from our infinite reactor.

460
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:07,900
And so we can define this as
1 over their neutron velocity,

461
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,700
times sigma absorption.

462
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,220
And just to check
the units here--

463
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,110
velocities in meters per second.

464
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:19,810
Macroscopic cross-sections
are in 1 over meters.

465
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,590
So those cancel
out, and we're left

466
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,650
with a total units of seconds.

467
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,190
That's nice.

468
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:30,490
We would want a mean
neutron lifetime,

469
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:36,310
or a prompt lifetime to have
of seconds or time, at least.

470
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,017
Yep.

471
00:25:37,017 --> 00:25:39,309
AUDIENCE: Can you say again
why the [INAUDIBLE] squared

472
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:40,117
went away?

473
00:25:40,117 --> 00:25:42,200
MICHAEL SHORT: Why the d
phi dt squared went away?

474
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,910
AUDIENCE: No, the
[INAUDIBLE] square.

475
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,840
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, OK.

476
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,030
So that's because
we assume we're

477
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,460
going to be analyzing
an infinite medium.

478
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:53,990
So right here, this to
relabel these terms,

479
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,790
this would be the
total production term.

480
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,430
That right there
represents absorption.

481
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,100
And that right there
represents leakage.

482
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,440
But if we're analyzing
an infinite medium,

483
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,980
you can't leak out, because it
takes up the entire universe

484
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:17,810
and beyond, depending on what
you believe metaphysically.

485
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,850
That's different costs.

486
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:30,420
So this right here, we can
rewrite as 1 over lifetime.

487
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,400
That makes it easier.

488
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:39,580
And this right here,
if we note that nu--

489
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,270
that's a nu.

490
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,895
I'm going to be really
explicit about that.

491
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,740
Nu sigma fission over
sigma absorption.

492
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:55,750
This kind of looks like this
is looking to be like k--

493
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,350
wrong color.

494
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:03,030
--like our k infinity over lp.

495
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:06,710
So all of a sudden we of
a much simpler relation.

496
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:15,600
We have 5 prime over 5
equals k infinity minus 1

497
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,180
over the prompt
neutron lifetime.

498
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,980
So if we solve this, this
is just an exponential.

499
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:27,170
So we end up with our phi
as a function of t is--

500
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:30,540
whatever flux we started
at, like for your power

501
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,380
in manipulations, it would be
whatever the neutron flux was

502
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:38,760
before you touch the control
rod, times e to the t,

503
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:47,370
or e to the that stuff, k
infinity minus 1 over lp,

504
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:56,718
times t, which we can
rewrite as t over capital T.

505
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,510
We're going to define
this symbol as what's

506
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,650
called the reactor period.

507
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,530
What the reactor
period actually says

508
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:24,410
is how long before the flux
increases by a factor of e.

509
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,610
And so this is actually
what that meter

510
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,860
was measuring on the reactor.

511
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,120
It's the reactor
period or the time

512
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,190
it would then take for
the reactor's power

513
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:43,280
to increase by a factor of e
because it's an exponential.

514
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,540
To tell you what these
typical reactor periods tend

515
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:52,310
to be for a thermal
reactor, t is

516
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:58,850
about 0.1 seconds corresponding
to an average prompt neutron

517
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:04,800
lifetime of 10 to
the minus 4 seconds.

518
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,780
Seems fast, doesn't it?

519
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,400
Like, really fast.

520
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,040
So the question I asked you
guys is, why don't reactors

521
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,089
just blow up?

522
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:14,390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

523
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,130
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes,
there is something

524
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,480
we've neglected from here.

525
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,380
It's like what Sarah said.

526
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,630
And it deserves its own board.

527
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,535
There is a fraction
of delayed neutrons.

528
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,250
We'll give that fraction
the symbol, beta.

529
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:43,530
And for a uranium 235,
it equals about 0.0064.

530
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:46,890
So there's less than a percent
of all the neutrons coming out

531
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:50,190
of a reactor have some delay
to them, because they're not

532
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:54,450
made directly from fission in
the 10 to the minus 14 seconds

533
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,430
that we talked about
in the timeline.

534
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:01,220
But they come out of
radioactive decay processes

535
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:12,070
with delayed lifetimes
ranging from about 0.2 seconds

536
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,585
to about 54 seconds.

537
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,370
This is the whole reason why
reactors don't just blow up.

538
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:23,700
So you can actually make a
reactor go super critical.

539
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:33,270
But if the k effective
is less than 1 plus beta,

540
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:38,147
then the reactor is not what
we call prompt super critical.

541
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:48,080
And so the reason for that is,
let's say you raise the reactor

542
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:56,340
power by some amount and the
k effective goes up to 1.005,

543
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,940
there's still this fraction
0.0064 of the neutrons

544
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,970
are not going to be
released immediately.

545
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:05,370
They're going to be released not
in 10 to the minus 14 seconds,

546
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:07,350
but in 10 to the 2 seconds.

547
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:10,170
So a measly 15
orders of magnitude

548
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,660
slower, meaning that
there's actually

549
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:16,890
some ability for this reactor
to raise its power level.

550
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,810
And these delayed neutrons,
even though that's

551
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,990
such a small fraction,
takes the reactor period

552
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:27,350
from its t infinity value
of about 0.1 seconds

553
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:31,550
to about 100 seconds.

554
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,260
So the same reactor
when you account

555
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:36,440
for the delayed neutrons
increases in power

556
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,343
by a factor of e.

557
00:31:37,343 --> 00:31:39,260
And it takes it about
100 seconds, which means

558
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,002
this is totally controllable.

559
00:31:42,002 --> 00:31:43,460
Now I have a question
for you guys.

560
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,670
Would you guys like me
to derive this formula,

561
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,740
or do you want to go into
more of the intuitive

562
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,730
implications of it?

563
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:52,960
Because we can go either way.

564
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,120
There is a formula
that will tell you

565
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,240
what the reactor period and
time dependence will be.

566
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,590
And you will hit it
in 22.05 probably.

567
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,850
I can't guarantee it
because I'm not teaching it.

568
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:06,370
Or we can talk a little bit
more about some of the intuition

569
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,610
behind delayed neutrons.

570
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:11,680
So a bit of choose
your own adventure.

571
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,730
Math or intuition?

572
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:13,720
AUDIENCE: Intuition.

573
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,762
MICHAEL SHORT: Intuition.

574
00:32:14,762 --> 00:32:16,450
OK, that's fine.

575
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,740
Good.

576
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:22,300
So that was the derivation.

577
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,790
I'll post that anyway,
if you guys want to see.

578
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:28,270
I think in the Yip reading
it says, let's account

579
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,950
for the delayed neutrons.

580
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:33,340
Intuitively we find that
the answer ends up being--

581
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,350
so I'll skip the derivation.

582
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:44,270
And it comes out to phi
naught e to the beta minus 1,

583
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:54,740
times k minus 1 over lt, plus
beta phi naught over beta minus

584
00:32:54,740 --> 00:33:01,940
1k, minus 1, times 1 minus e
to the beta minus 1k, minus 1

585
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,110
over l.

586
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:07,145
OK, so left as an
exercise to the reader--

587
00:33:07,145 --> 00:33:08,270
AUDIENCE: That's intuitive.

588
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,490
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
that's intuitive.

589
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:13,098
But let's actually talk
about how intuitive it is.

590
00:33:13,098 --> 00:33:15,140
I do want to give you the
starting and the ending

591
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,530
equation.

592
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,750
And we will not go
through the rest.

593
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,240
Yeah, Charlie?

594
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,590
AUDIENCE: Should
we copy that down?

595
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,530
MICHAEL SHORT:
No, you shouldn't.

596
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,947
I'm going to scan
it for you guys.

597
00:33:20,947 --> 00:33:22,610
So don't bother copying it down.

598
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,530
Let's talk about
where it comes from.

599
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,990
And the answer may
astound you because we're

600
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:29,540
going to bring right back the
idea of series radioactive

601
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,690
decay.

602
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:35,450
So let's say you want
to relate the change

603
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:41,020
in the number in the
neutron flux to a 1 minus--

604
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,700
I'm going to take a quick
look at the original equation

605
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,717
because I don't want
to screw that up.

606
00:33:46,717 --> 00:33:48,800
That's the first page, and
that's the one we want.

607
00:33:51,132 --> 00:33:53,340
Let's say we had some
equations that looked something

608
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:53,970
like this.

609
00:34:00,802 --> 00:34:05,710
Phi plus phi naught times beta.

610
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,750
This is the original
differential equation

611
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,403
from whence it came.

612
00:34:09,403 --> 00:34:11,320
And the intuitive part
that I want you to note

613
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,060
is that the jump from
changing k effective

614
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:20,719
is moderated by this term
right here, 1 minus beta.

615
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:29,090
So that's the fraction
of prompt neutrons,

616
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:31,100
that as soon as you pull
the control rod out,

617
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,281
that's your
instantaneous feedback.

618
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:35,239
By instantaneous, I mean
on the order of, like,

619
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,980
10 to the minus 4
seconds, or something

620
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,929
that you can't really control.

621
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:41,104
This right here represents
the delayed fraction.

622
00:34:44,873 --> 00:34:47,040
This is as mathy as it's
going to get because you've

623
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,150
chosen intuition.

624
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,929
I think you have chosen wisely.

625
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:51,570
It's going to be a more fun.

626
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:54,060
So what this
represents right here

627
00:34:54,060 --> 00:35:02,090
is your kind of instant change,
because whatever you change

628
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,040
k effective to, it's
going to be moderated

629
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:08,000
by the prompt fraction, how
long the neutrons tend to take

630
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,090
to undergo that feedback.

631
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:09,590
Yes, Sara?

632
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,087
AUDIENCE: Was that the average?

633
00:35:11,087 --> 00:35:12,420
MICHAEL SHORT: The average what?

634
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,625
AUDIENCE: Average
neutron lifetime.

635
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:17,000
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes, this is
the average neutron lifetime.

636
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,300
So let's define the
average neutron lifetime

637
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:27,580
as simply 1 minus beta times
the prompt neutron lifetime,

638
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:36,680
plus the beta times some
delayed neutron lifetime.

639
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,160
So what no book I've
ever seen actually says,

640
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,910
this is what's referred to
as a Maxwell mixing model.

641
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,030
It's just the simplest
thing to say, oh,

642
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,030
if you want to get the
average of some variable,

643
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:58,080
take the fraction of one
species times its variable,

644
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,750
plus the fraction of the other
species, times its variable.

645
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,420
Folks do the same thing
with electrical resistivity,

646
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,180
thermal conductivity, or
any sort of other material

647
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,140
property.

648
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,570
And it is or isn't good
in some situations.

649
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:14,840
Like, if you had a piece
of material made out

650
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,030
of two different things--

651
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,550
let's say this had
thermal conductivity k1,

652
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,750
and it had thermal
conductivity K2.

653
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:24,290
Would a Maxwell mixing model
be appropriate to describe

654
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:27,080
the flow of heat
across this thing?

655
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,550
Probably not.

656
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,000
But in the case
of neutrons where

657
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,260
they're flying about like crazy
and their mean free path is

658
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:36,470
much larger than the
distance between atoms,

659
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,090
this works great.

660
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:50,870
So we can define this
mean neutron lifetime

661
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:53,400
and use that in this
equation right here.

662
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,580
So this term right
here describes

663
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,840
the instantaneous change.

664
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,510
You pull the control
rods out, and fraction 1

665
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:03,740
minus beta neutrons
respond immediately.

666
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:06,970
What about that
fraction of neutrons?

667
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:10,240
Those are being produced
with a fraction beta

668
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,610
depending on what
the flux was before,

669
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:15,640
because they're still waiting to
decay from the old power level.

670
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:25,980
Does anyone notice anything
suspiciously familiar

671
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:30,810
about the final form of
this equation for flux?

672
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:33,420
You've seen it
before with a couple

673
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,070
of constants changed around.

674
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:42,324
What about the form of
this differential equation?

675
00:37:42,324 --> 00:37:43,710
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

676
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:46,860
It is exactly the same as
series radioactive decay.

677
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,920
So the horrible derivation I
was going to do for you guys

678
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,910
and we're not anymore is,
use an integrating factor.

679
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:56,430
You solve it in
exactly the same way.

680
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:59,650
You bring everything to
one side of the equation.

681
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:03,000
Find some factor mu, that
makes this a product rule.

682
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,590
Do a lot of algebra.

683
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:08,610
And you end up with a very
suspiciously similar looking

684
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:09,390
equation.

685
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:13,350
So it's exactly the
same posing and solution

686
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:16,350
as series radioactive decay,
with the difference being,

687
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,240
that's the constant in
front of everything,

688
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,090
instead of a bunch of
lambdas and fluxes.

689
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,600
So what this says here is that
the flux as a function of time,

690
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,270
this is the prompt
feedback right here,

691
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,040
which says that
if-- let's graph it,

692
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,350
since we're going intuitive.

693
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,430
There's no room.

694
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:36,980
Even those all boards are full.

695
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,340
OK, here we go.

696
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:44,200
If we graft time
and flux right here,

697
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,993
what that part
right there says is

698
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:47,410
that you're going
to get some sort

699
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:51,690
of instantaneous
exponential feedback.

700
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:54,870
But it's going to be moderated
by this one minus exponential

701
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:57,920
on top.

702
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:04,250
So you're going to end up with
a little bit of prompt feedback,

703
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,230
this stuff right here.

704
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:15,150
And then-- have to draw longer
because it's going to take

705
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,970
forever--

706
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:22,010
you'll have some
delayed feedback,

707
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,550
because you've got to
wait 100 or so seconds,

708
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,690
or whatever that new
reactor period is,

709
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,685
for the delayed
neutrons to take effect.

710
00:39:28,685 --> 00:39:31,310
And that's the whole reason you
could pull the control rods out

711
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:35,540
at almost any speed you wanted
and the reactor doesn't just

712
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,800
explode.

713
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,500
If you pull the control
rods out fast enough, such

714
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,370
that the change in k effective
is greater than beta,

715
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:46,370
then the reactor goes
prompt super critical,

716
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:49,190
which means you don't have any
delayed neutrons slowing down

717
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,360
the feedback.

718
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,010
And you've kind of turned
your reactor into a weapon.

719
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:56,630
A very poor,
terrible weapon, but

720
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:00,550
a prompt super critical
nuclear device, nonetheless.

721
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:03,300
Did anybody pull out the
control rods too fast

722
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,747
and the controls
took over for you?

723
00:40:05,747 --> 00:40:07,080
What about you guys in training?

724
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,810
Did you ever do things when you
watched the automatic control

725
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,640
take over?

726
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,388
No?

727
00:40:12,388 --> 00:40:13,762
AUDIENCE: It'll just take over.

728
00:40:13,762 --> 00:40:16,060
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it'll kick you
off if you don't pay attention.

729
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,477
MICHAEL SHORT:
That's what I mean.

730
00:40:17,477 --> 00:40:20,020
The machine takes over
and it will kick you off

731
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,280
and stop responding to you.

732
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
horrible noise

733
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,520
and so we don't want that.

734
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,663
It's more to avoid
an annoying alarm.

735
00:40:26,663 --> 00:40:27,550
MICHAEL SHORT: I see.

736
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,170
But the annoying
alarm is to stop you

737
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,690
from doing something like that,
like, making the reactor go

738
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:32,607
prompt super critical.

739
00:40:32,607 --> 00:40:33,912
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

740
00:40:33,912 --> 00:40:35,620
MICHAEL SHORT: OK, so
that's what I would

741
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,090
call the machine taking over.

742
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:38,942
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

743
00:40:38,942 --> 00:40:41,400
AUDIENCE: It'll kick you on to
manual, and then [INAUDIBLE]

744
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,547
still don't do
anything [INAUDIBLE]..

745
00:40:43,547 --> 00:40:44,380
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

746
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,920
So if your blood alcohol
level is above beta

747
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,930
and you try and, let's
say, increase the reactor

748
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,750
reactivity too much, it
will then take over, insert

749
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,420
a control rod, make a horrible
noise, and say, go home,

750
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,330
you're drunk.

751
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,250
Something like that.

752
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,660
OK, that makes sense to me.

753
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:04,500
So what did your guys' reactor
power traces look like?

754
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,295
Did they look
something like this,

755
00:41:07,295 --> 00:41:09,670
where there was an initial
rise as you pulled the control

756
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,180
right out?

757
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:13,810
And then after you pulled the
control rod out the power kept

758
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:16,098
rising just a smidge, right?

759
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:18,390
And what happened when you
put the control rod back in?

760
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,960
Let's say you put the
control rod back in.

761
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,990
You're going to get another
prompt drop, not equal

762
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:29,000
to the same prompt
gain that you got,

763
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,900
because now the reactor's
at a different flux,

764
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,280
and then some asymptotic
feedback like that.

765
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,900
And so this is why to
those who don't understand

766
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,200
neutron physics, reactor
feedback is very non-intuitive.

767
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,607
It's not a linear system.

768
00:41:42,607 --> 00:41:45,190
You can't just pull the control
right out and change the power

769
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,340
accordingly.

770
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,600
This is why there's automated
controls in systems to stop you

771
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,610
in case, like I said,
if your blood alcohol

772
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:55,227
content's above beta, which
is very low, by the way.

773
00:41:55,227 --> 00:41:57,060
Though you shouldn't
be drinking on the job,

774
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,010
especially at a nuclear reactor.

775
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:01,870
Plus, you're all under 21,
so what am I even saying?

776
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:03,800
AUDIENCE: What is alcohol?

777
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,450
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

778
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,470
Good answer.

779
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,333
What is alcohol?

780
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:10,500
AUDIENCE: Is that going to
be covered in [INAUDIBLE]

781
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,760
MICHAEL SHORT: That'll
be on the exam, yeah.

782
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,380
AUDIENCE: What is alcohol?

783
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,380
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, cool.

784
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,260
So that's all I want to go
into for the intuitive stuff.

785
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,360
And it's about 5 of 5 of.

786
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,240
So I'd like to stop here and see
if you guys have any questions

787
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,790
on neutron physics at a whole.

788
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,790
Noting that we're going
to take Thursday's class

789
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,040
and turn into a recitation.

790
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,800
So I would like all of you guys
to look at the problem set,

791
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,510
because it is posted.

792
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,860
It is hard.

793
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,050
Trust me.

794
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:40,582
This one's a doozy.

795
00:42:40,582 --> 00:42:42,290
So I want to warn you
guys because you've

796
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:43,640
got seven days to work on it.

797
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,820
But I want you to look at it so
that we can start formulating

798
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:50,150
strategies for the problems
together on Thursday,

799
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,210
because there are
some tricks to it.

800
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,160
You guys know me by now, right?

801
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,660
There's always some
sort of a trick.

802
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,610
Like, do you have to
integrate every energy

803
00:42:58,610 --> 00:42:59,720
to get the stopping power?

804
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,103
No, you actually don't have
to do any integrals at all.

805
00:43:02,103 --> 00:43:03,770
But you can if you
want, and your answer

806
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:05,210
will be more
accurate and correct.

807
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,220
It'll just take
longer to get to.

808
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,340
So there's a lot of diminishing
returns on these problems sets.

809
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,140
If you're willing
to take an hour

810
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,670
and think about
how can I do this

811
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:16,640
simpler and with
fewer decimal points,

812
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,670
you're probably onto something.

813
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,190
And we'll work on those
strategies together.

814
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:23,420
AUDIENCE: Is this due
next Monday as well?

815
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,890
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

816
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:27,453
So I posted it yesterday
at around noon or whatever

817
00:43:27,453 --> 00:43:28,370
the Stellar site says.

818
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:36,710
I'll also teach you guys
explicitly how to use Janus.

819
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:40,070
So we got a comment in from
the anonymous feedback saying,

820
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:41,813
we have to use a
lot of software.

821
00:43:41,813 --> 00:43:43,730
Can we have some sort
of tutorial for dummies?

822
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:45,563
Well, you guys aren't
dummies, but you still

823
00:43:45,563 --> 00:43:46,500
deserve a tutorial.

824
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,520
So I will show you how
to export the data you'll

825
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,530
need from this
problem set for Janus.

826
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:53,960
So you can focus on the
intuition and the physics

827
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,450
and not get frustrated with
getting data out of a computer.

828
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,370
So any questions on anything
from the neutron diffusion

829
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:04,420
equation?

830
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,050
Yeah, Luke.

831
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:07,816
AUDIENCE: I'm not real clear
on [INAUDIBLE] neutrons are

832
00:44:07,816 --> 00:44:10,300
and how those are different
from the prompt neutrons?

833
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,717
MICHAEL SHORT: The
prompt neutrons

834
00:44:11,717 --> 00:44:12,950
come right out of fission.

835
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,010
If we looked at
that timeline of,

836
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:18,350
let's say the fission
event happens here.

837
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:23,870
Two fission products
are released in about 10

838
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,870
to the minus 14 seconds.

839
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:30,090
They move a little
further apart.

840
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:32,420
And then some of them
just boil off neutrons,

841
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:36,170
because they're so neutron
heavy, after around 10

842
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:39,500
to the minus 13 seconds or so.

843
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,740
These right here
are prop neutrons,

844
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:46,310
coming directly from the
immediate decay of neutron

845
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:47,900
rich fission products.

846
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:51,560
Some of the delayed neutrons
come from radioactive decay,

847
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,050
but of the much later
fission products

848
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:57,830
with much less
likely occurrences,

849
00:44:57,830 --> 00:44:59,840
which is why the
fraction is very low.

850
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,630
But also, because it's
much longer half life,

851
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:05,150
those delayed neutrons
take seconds, instead

852
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:07,115
of pico seconds, to show up.

853
00:45:07,115 --> 00:45:10,310
And that's the whole basis
behind easier control

854
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:12,170
and feedback a reactor.

855
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:14,840
Good question.

856
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,360
So anything starting
from neutron transport

857
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,670
to simplifying to
neutron diffusion,

858
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:22,340
to getting to this
criticality condition,

859
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,770
making the two group
criticality condition if you

860
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:28,160
want to have fast and thermal,
or any of the time dependent

861
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,630
stuff that we intuited today.

862
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:32,130
Yeah?

863
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:34,088
AUDIENCE: So for that
cross-section [INAUDIBLE]

864
00:45:34,088 --> 00:45:36,885
you have there, so you have
one for 235 and one for 238.

865
00:45:36,885 --> 00:45:41,348
235, it has to be thermal
neutrons [INAUDIBLE] fast?

866
00:45:41,348 --> 00:45:42,140
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

867
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,182
AUDIENCE: And you said
that [INAUDIBLE] different

868
00:45:44,182 --> 00:45:45,760
[INAUDIBLE] as well it had--

869
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,653
if you have
[INAUDIBLE] into the--

870
00:45:49,653 --> 00:45:51,320
MICHAEL SHORT: Was
it on the other board

871
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,139
or from a different day?

872
00:45:52,139 --> 00:45:53,597
AUDIENCE: It was
a different board.

873
00:45:53,597 --> 00:45:55,840
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

874
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:59,018
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so could
you explain that graph?

875
00:45:59,018 --> 00:45:59,810
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

876
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:02,442
So in this case--

877
00:46:02,442 --> 00:46:06,650
let me get a finer chalk.

878
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:08,930
This blue one would be
for low temperature,

879
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:12,990
and this red one would
be for high temperature.

880
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:14,910
So this blue graph,
there are resonances,

881
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:18,630
which have very high values,
but they're very narrow.

882
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:21,900
And because the width of a
resonance doesn't matter,

883
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,460
it doesn't affect
the probability

884
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,030
that a neutron scatters up
here and moves some distance

885
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:28,680
down the energy spectrum.

886
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,020
Thinner resonances tend
to get passed over,

887
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:34,510
especially if your reactor's
full of hydrogen. Some

888
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:37,300
of those neutrons will
be born and immediately

889
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,730
jump into the
thermal region, where

890
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,580
it's easy to tell how much
fission they'll undergo.

891
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,800
As you go up in
temperature, you undergo

892
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:53,990
what's called Doppler
broadening, which

893
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:57,680
causes these resonances to
spread out and also go down

894
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,830
in value.

895
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:01,250
So the actual value
of the cross-section

896
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:05,700
at these residences is lower,
but the widths are larger.

897
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,630
So there's a higher probability
that a neutron scattering

898
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,850
around and losing
energy will hit

899
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:13,610
one of these higher
cross-section regions, called

900
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:18,340
a resonance, at a
higher temperature.

901
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,740
That's the difference there,
is these two plots show

902
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:25,450
the same cross-section at
low and high temperature.

903
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:29,410
These plots show the
difference between uranium 235

904
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:33,190
and uranium 238.

905
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:34,390
Good question.

906
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:34,960
Anyone else?

907
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,550
Cool.

908
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:44,670
OK, for the first
time in history,

909
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:47,220
I'll let you out a minute early.

910
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,410
Bring all your
questions on Thursday.

911
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:51,870
So we'll start off
with a Janus tutorial.

912
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:54,756
And then we'll start attacking
this problem set together.
