8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,500
PROFESSOR: OK, guys.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,490
We're actually
slightly ahead of where

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,500
I thought we'd be at
this point, so I'm only

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,900
going to spend about
half of today's lecture

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,120
finishing up some new
material on mass parabolas

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,200
and stability.

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,368
I also got a comment in
through the anonymous box

15
00:00:36,368 --> 00:00:38,160
that said please leave
a little bit of time

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,098
after class for questions.

17
00:00:40,098 --> 00:00:42,390
So you can get them out right
away, because I'm usually

18
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,348
running off to teach some
other class at, like,

19
00:00:44,348 --> 00:00:46,283
the IDC or some other building.

20
00:00:46,283 --> 00:00:47,700
So from now on,
I'll try and leave

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,320
about five minutes
at the end of class

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,090
for questions on
today's material,

23
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,180
and we'll make up with the
second half-hour or 25 minutes

24
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,740
of this class being for all
the questions on the material

25
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,547
so far in the first two weeks.

26
00:00:58,547 --> 00:01:00,630
But first I wanted to give
a quick review of where

27
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,780
we were Wednesday and launch
back into mass parabolas, which

28
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,170
are ways of looking at nuclear
stability in relative numbers

29
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,370
and even or oddness of nuclei.

30
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,100
So you saw last
time we intuitively

31
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,860
derived the semi-empirical
mass formula

32
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,620
as a sum of volume,
surface, coulomb, asymmetry,

33
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,850
and pairing, or whether things
are even-even or odd-even terms

34
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,140
with the coefficients in
MeV gleaned from data,

35
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,770
and the forms of the-- and the
exponents right here gleaned

36
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,420
from intuition.

37
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,950
Here we assume that
the nucleus can

38
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,010
be thought of like a big drop
of liquid with some charged

39
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,400
particles in it.

40
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,430
And so the droplet
should become more stable

41
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,820
the more nuclei there are-- or
the more nucleons there are.

42
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,740
But then you have
some more outside

43
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,840
on the surface that aren't
bonded to the others.

44
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,388
All of the protons are repelling
each other over linear length

45
00:01:52,388 --> 00:01:54,305
scales, because the
radius of this liquid drop

46
00:01:54,305 --> 00:01:56,560
would scale like A to the 1/3.

47
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,130
There's an asymmetry term,
which means if the neutrons

48
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,470
and protons are out
of balance, there's

49
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,548
going to be some
less binding energy.

50
00:02:04,548 --> 00:02:06,090
And then there's
this extra part that

51
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,780
tells you whether the nuclei
are even-even or odd-odd.

52
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,820
And this works pretty well.

53
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,580
If you remember, we looked
at theory versus experiment

54
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,910
where all the red points here
are theoretical predictions,

55
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,730
and all the black points are
experimental predictions.

56
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,560
And for the most part,
they look spot-on.

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,650
It generates the classic
binding energy per nucleon

58
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,540
curve that you see
in the textbook

59
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,660
and can predict from the
semi-empirical mass formula.

60
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,570
Zooming in and correcting
for, let's say,

61
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,740
just getting absolute
values of errors,

62
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,880
you can see that, except
for the very small nuclei

63
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,160
and a few peaks,
which we explained

64
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,130
by looking even closer,
the formula, well,

65
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,085
it predicts nuclear stability
quite well on average.

66
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,710
Again, this line
right here, if there's

67
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,790
a dot that lies
on this blue line,

68
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,660
it means that theory
and experiment agree.

69
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,860
And a deviation by a few MeV
here and there, not too bad.

70
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,620
But we started also looking
at different nuclear stability

71
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,610
trends, and we noticed that
for odd mass number nuclei,

72
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,500
there's usually only one or
sometimes none stable isotopes

73
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,830
per Z, whereas for even ones,
there's quite a few more.

74
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,540
And we're going to
be now linking up

75
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,600
the stability of nuclei
versus what mode of decay

76
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,590
they will take in order to find
a more stable configuration.

77
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,650
We looked quickly at the number
of stable nuclei with even

78
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,370
and odd Z and noted that
these places right here where

79
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,300
there are no stable nuclei
correspond to technetium

80
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,740
and promethium.

81
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,000
There's no periodic table
on the back of this wall,

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,765
but behind my back
on the other wall,

83
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:40,140
there's that
periodic table where

84
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,510
you can see the two
elements that are fairly

85
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,340
light with no stable isotopes.

86
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,290
That's what those correspond to.

87
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,950
And the peaks correspond to
what we call magic numbers

88
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,650
or numbers of
protons or neutrons

89
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,630
where all available
states at some energy

90
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,040
are pretty much filled.

91
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,050
And this goes for both
protons and neutrons.

92
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:03,180
So something with a magic number
for both n, number of neutrons,

93
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,740
and Z, number of
protons, is going

94
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,625
to be exceptionally stable.

95
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,250
And we'll see how
that's used as a tool

96
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,370
to synthesize the super heavy
elements that we believe

97
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,070
should exist.

98
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,470
And finally we got into
these mass parabolas.

99
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,750
I found this to be a
particularly difficult concept

100
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,640
to just get mathematically.

101
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,700
If you remember, we wrote out
the semi-empirical mass formula

102
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,880
and said if you take the
derivative with respect to Z,

103
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,550
as we did it, you would get the
most stable z for a given A.

104
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,350
And we started graphing
for a equals 93

105
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,782
where niobium is stable.

106
00:04:36,782 --> 00:04:39,240
That was just the one I had on
the brain from some failures

107
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,460
in lab earlier this week.

108
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,830
We started plotting
where those nuclei--

109
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,150
what is it-- the relative
masses are for a fixed A. So

110
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,830
let's regenerate
that one right now,

111
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,290
because we were a little fast
at the end of last lecture.

112
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,132
Then I want to generate
one for a equals 40.

113
00:04:56,132 --> 00:04:57,840
And you'll see something
kind of curious.

114
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,090
I'm going to leave
this up here for a sec.

115
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,150
If you notice, for
odd A nuclei, there's

116
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,895
only one parabola, whereas
for even A, there are two.

117
00:05:06,895 --> 00:05:08,520
Why that is, we're
going to see when we

118
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,090
look at the table of nuclides.

119
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,450
But notice this
nucleus right here

120
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:16,230
can decay by either positron
emission or beta emission

121
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,520
to get to a more stable form.

122
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,895
And there are many
real examples,

123
00:05:18,895 --> 00:05:22,270
and I'm going to show
you how to find them.

124
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,160
So let's start off by going
back to the table of nuclides,

125
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,330
finding niobium-93.

126
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,520
Just go up one more chunk.

127
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,650
And there we are.

128
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,280
Niobium-93 is a stable isotope.

129
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,030
And if you want to see
where it came from,

130
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,080
you can scroll down a little
bit and see its possible parent

131
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,010
nuclides right here.

132
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,670
So let's say that niobium--

133
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,560
we'll draw it right there--

134
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,190
is stable.

135
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,850
We'll put it at the
bottom of this parabola.

136
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:57,560
And let's work down in Z.
So we'll move to zirconium.

137
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,240
Zirconium-93 ostensibly has
a very similar atomic mass.

138
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,040
But if you remember that 93 AMU
is a rather poor approximation

139
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,180
for the actual mass of all
nuclei with A equals 93.

140
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,330
In fact, if you look very
closely at the atomic masses,

141
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,660
zirconium-93 is 92.90.

142
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,060
Niobium-93, well,
it looks like we

143
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,310
have to go all the way
to another digit there.

144
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,560
92.906.

145
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,680
You have to go to, like,
even more digits 92.906375,

146
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,290
92.906475.

147
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,270
So we go down in Z,
and we've actually

148
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,170
gone up in mass by looks like
the sixth or seventh digit

149
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,470
in AMU.

150
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,430
If we go up in mass, we
go down in binding energy.

151
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,010
That tells us that there's
something that's less stable.

152
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,650
And if you notice, we went
down by a very small--

153
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,950
or we went up by a very
small amount of mass.

154
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,820
Notice also that its beta decay
energy is really, really small,

155
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,070
91 kiloelectron volts.

156
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:03,670
So why don't we put
zirconium just above?

157
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,390
And we note that that
decay will happen

158
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,860
by beta, where the
beta, let's say

159
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,280
if we have an isotope with
mass number A, protons Z,

160
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,030
and let's just call it
symbol question mark.

161
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,810
In beta decay, we
have the same A.

162
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,820
We'll have a different
Z. We're going

163
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,740
to have to give these symbols.

164
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,880
Let's call this parent, and
we'll call that daughter.

165
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,517
Plus a beta, plus an
electron antineutrino.

166
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:34,850
And what has to happen to
that Z in order for everything

167
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,980
to be conserved?

168
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,750
It's the same reaction
that we've got here for--

169
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,640
I'm sorry-- for zirconium.

170
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:47,100
So you'd have to have one fewer
proton to release one electron.

171
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,320
And so that becomes
same A but different Z.

172
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,120
And this is the
beta decay reaction.

173
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,560
Let's go back a little farther.

174
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,645
We'll look at the possible
parent nuclide for--

175
00:08:00,645 --> 00:08:01,770
did anyone have a question?

176
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,560
AUDIENCE: Don't you need
one more proton [INAUDIBLE]??

177
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,600
PROFESSOR: Let's see.

178
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,580
Which direction are
we going in Z here?

179
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,252
That goes to yttrium.

180
00:08:14,252 --> 00:08:16,298
It actually looks
like it's going down.

181
00:08:16,298 --> 00:08:17,340
Oh, yeah, for beta decay.

182
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,030
I'm thinking-- I have
the reaction backwards.

183
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,870
Sorry.

184
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,380
I need one more
proton to account

185
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,630
for the extra negative charge.

186
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,750
You're right.

187
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,290
OK.

188
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,290
Yep, I was thinking
backwards, because we're now

189
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,799
climbing up the decay
chain in reverse order.

190
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,980
So this could have come
from yttrium-93 with a much

191
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,480
higher energy of three MeV.

192
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,809
So let's put yttrium right here.

193
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,330
That gives a beta decay.

194
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:52,750
And we'll just go one more
back to strontium-93 Has

195
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,507
an even higher
beta decay energy.

196
00:08:56,507 --> 00:08:57,590
So let's put that up here.

197
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,120
And let's take a look
at its mass real quick.

198
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,270
The mass of
strontium-93, 92.914 AMU.

199
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:13,290
If we go back to
niobium-93, now it's

200
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,410
noticeably different to,
like, four significant digits

201
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,178
instead of six.

202
00:09:17,178 --> 00:09:21,540
92.914 versus 92.906.

203
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,780
And so that shows you that
a tiny bit of mass and AMU

204
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,850
corresponds to a pretty
significant change

205
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,450
in binding energy by that
same conversion factor

206
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,630
that we've been
using everywhere.

207
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:45,910
931.49 AMU per big
MeV per C squared.

208
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,570
Let's see.

209
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,170
Yeah.

210
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:48,670
OK.

211
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,690
So let's go now in the other
direction, in the positron

212
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:54,900
direction.

213
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:00,410
Niobium can also be
made by electron capture

214
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,820
from molybdenum.

215
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,860
So let's put
molybdenum right here.

216
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,113
Let's say that around half an--

217
00:10:08,113 --> 00:10:09,030
what did we have here?

218
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,030
It was like half an MeV.

219
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,697
Like that.

220
00:10:15,697 --> 00:10:16,280
And let's see.

221
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,670
Molybdenum-93 could have
been made by electron capture

222
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,905
from technetium-93 with
an energy of 3.201 MeV,

223
00:10:24,905 --> 00:10:25,655
even more extreme.

224
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,080
We'll go back one more, because
there's a trend that I want

225
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,850
you guys to be able to see.

226
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,830
And this could have come
from electron capture

227
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,620
from ruthenium.

228
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,570
I think I may have said
rubidium last time,

229
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,350
but Ru is ruthenium-93.

230
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:52,740
And that 6.3 MeV,
something like that.

231
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,400
And this is where
we got to yesterday.

232
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,950
Now I'd like us to take a
closer look at the decay

233
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,640
diagrams, which tells us what
possible decay reactions can

234
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,580
happen in each of
these reactions.

235
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,080
Since we're right
here on the chart,

236
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,520
let's take a look at ruthenium
turning into technetium by what

237
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,840
it says, electron capture.

238
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,900
So note that on the table, you
can click on electron capture,

239
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,870
and if it's highlighted, then
the decay diagrams are known.

240
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,150
It's not known
for every isotope,

241
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:23,020
but for a lot of the ones
you'll be dealing with, it is.

242
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,990
And you get something I
have to zoom out for--

243
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,600
a lot, a lot of
different decays.

244
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,150
What I want you to look at is
this one here on the bottom

245
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,400
that I'll zoom in to.

246
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,740
That should be a
little more visible.

247
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,100
So notice that if you want to
go down the entire 6.4-something

248
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:51,180
MeV, it usually proceeds by
B-plus or positron decay,

249
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,980
by either method.

250
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,160
And as you go up the chain, as
these energy differences get

251
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,130
smaller, look what
happens to the probability

252
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,900
of getting positron decay.

253
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,060
It shrinks lower
and lower and lower.

254
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,220
So there's a trend that
the larger the decay

255
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,310
energy for this type of
reaction, the more likely

256
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,710
you're going to
get positron decay.

257
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,650
And in fact, where we left
off last time is in order

258
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:18,120
to get positron decay, the
Q value of the reaction

259
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,730
has to be at least
1.022 MeV, better known

260
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:29,940
as at least two times the
rest mass of the electron,

261
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,580
because in this case, to
conserve charge and energy,

262
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,890
you shoot out a
positron, and you also

263
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,960
have to eject an
electron in order

264
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,160
to conserve all the
charge going on here.

265
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,940
So there you have it.

266
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,670
Now let's look at the lower
energy decay of technetium

267
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,230
to molybdenum,
which had something

268
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,620
like 3 MeV associated with it.

269
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,790
So we'll click on technetium,
and its energy is 3.2 MeV.

270
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,820
Let's take a look at
its electron capture.

271
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,430
Significantly simpler.

272
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,920
Already what do you notice
about these positron

273
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,045
to electron capture ratios?

274
00:13:09,568 --> 00:13:10,360
Anyone call it out.

275
00:13:14,072 --> 00:13:16,280
AUDIENCE: Electron capture
is much more likely.

276
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,030
PROFESSOR: Indeed.

277
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,070
When the energy of
the decay goes down--

278
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,980
notice that only these
decays are allowed--

279
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,040
The electron capture suddenly
becomes much more likely.

280
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,320
But notice that it does
not let you go directly

281
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,760
from 3.2 MeV to 0.

282
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,850
There is no
allowable decay here.

283
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,240
So this is probably a
change of-- that's 3.2.

284
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,830
That's 1.3.

285
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,840
A little less than 2 MeV.

286
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,280
All of a sudden,
electron capture

287
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,880
becomes much more likely,
but positron decay

288
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,430
is not disallowed yet.

289
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:50,910
So we can say electron capture
or positron decay right there.

290
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,450
Everyone with me so far?

291
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,130
So let's go to the
really low energy one.

292
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,840
We'll click on
molybdenum-93 and see

293
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,830
how it decays with an energy
of 0.405 MeV to niobium.

294
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:06,224
Anyone want to guess
what's allowed?

295
00:14:06,224 --> 00:14:08,000
AUDIENCE: Electron capture only.

296
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,830
PROFESSOR: Electron
capture only.

297
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,590
There's not enough energy
for positron decay.

298
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,480
And, indeed, it draws
funny, because there's

299
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,170
a metastable state.

300
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,990
But if you scroll
down here, there

301
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,960
are two pathways allowed, both
of which by electron capture.

302
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,132
Decay diagram's
quite a bit simpler.

303
00:14:24,132 --> 00:14:26,090
So we leave this one here
by saying it can only

304
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,830
decay by electron capture.

305
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,120
Any questions on
the odd A before we

306
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,130
move on to the even, which
is a little more interesting?

307
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:38,710
Cool.

308
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,080
OK.

309
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,300
Let's move on to the even case.

310
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,950
So for here, I'm
going to go back

311
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:48,030
to the overall picture
of the table of nuclides.

312
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,630
Click on around where I
think potassium-40 is.

313
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,020
Looks like I got there.

314
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,310
And I want to point out
one of these features.

315
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,890
If you wanted to
undergo decay change

316
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,530
and maintain the
same mass number,

317
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,140
that's diagonally from
upper left to lower right.

318
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:08,580
See how all the isotopes here
have a 40 in front of them.

319
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,580
The really interesting part
is as you cross this line,

320
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:16,350
you go from stable to unstable
to stable to unstable again.

321
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,230
The colors here is dark
blue represents stable,

322
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,870
and dark gray represents
long lifetimes

323
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,330
of over 100,000 years.

324
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,168
So this is one of the
reasons you find potassium-40

325
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:27,960
in the environment.

326
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,550
In fact, 0.011% of all
potassium in you and everything

327
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,990
is potassium-40.

328
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,810
It's what's known as
a primordial nuclide.

329
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,970
It's not stable,
but its half-life

330
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,010
is so long that
there's still some

331
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:45,190
left since the universe
began or whatever

332
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,560
supernova that formed Earth
got accumulated into the earth.

333
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,613
But notice it can come from--

334
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:53,530
it can decay by a couple
of different methods.

335
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:57,600
So let's pick one of those
stable isotopes, calcium-40,

336
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,930
and put that as the bottom of
the parabola on this diagram.

337
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,700
So we'll put calcium here.

338
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,160
And in a relative sense, we'll
put a calcium point right there

339
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,230
for its total mass.

340
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,510
And it could have
come from beta decay

341
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:19,330
from potassium-40 or electron
capture from scandium-40 40.

342
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,430
So let's look at potassium-40.

343
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:26,760
It can beta decay for
about, oh, 1.3 MeV.

344
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,150
So potassium is right here.

345
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:36,520
Let's say it could beta
decay with about 1.3 MeV.

346
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,320
And we'll trace potassium
back a little bit,

347
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,950
figure out where would
it have come from.

348
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,510
Interesting.

349
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,660
Doesn't tell us.

350
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,160
OK, forget that.

351
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:56,290
Let's trace calcium back
and say there's scandium-40.

352
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,030
And scandium-40 can
decay with-- wow--

353
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:04,430
an enormous 14.32 MeV.

354
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,900
Let's put that like here.

355
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,609
Anyone want to guess which mode,
electron capture or positrons,

356
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:16,390
much more likely?

357
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,121
AUDIENCE: I think positrons.

358
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,329
PROFESSOR: Probably positron.

359
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,180
Let's take a look.

360
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:22,960
Oh boy.

361
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,030
Another complicated one.

362
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,190
But the whole way down,
positron, positron,

363
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:30,280
positron for all the
most likely decays.

364
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,370
You won't find a drawing
to every single line.

365
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,650
I believe that they
know that at some point,

366
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,290
drawing extra lines is futile,
and they just all overlap

367
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,130
each other.

368
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,560
So I don't know exactly
how the algorithm works,

369
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,930
but it does draw up to some
number of possible decay

370
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:45,430
chains.

371
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,160
If you want to see
every single one,

372
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,058
they are tabulated in a very,
very long list down below.

373
00:17:53,058 --> 00:17:55,600
I'm never going to ask you to
do something with all of these,

374
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,670
because that would
be insane unless it's

375
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:00,340
a relatively simple
decay, like that

376
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,140
has two or three possibilities.

377
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,490
And let's see.

378
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,320
This could have come
from electron capture

379
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,210
from titanium-40 with 11.68 MeV.

380
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:11,810
Wow.

381
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,830
OK.

382
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,330
Up here.

383
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,880
And there's titanium.

384
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,990
And let's go in the
other direction.

385
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:31,780
So I do know that potassium-40
can decay into argon-40.

386
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:36,330
So let's jump there.

387
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,280
Argon is a stable isotope too.

388
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:45,800
So potassium-40 can decay into
argon-40 by electron capture.

389
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,300
OK, good.

390
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:56,150
A more respectable 1.505 MeV.

391
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,380
Is positron decay allowed?

392
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,630
AUDIENCE: Yes.

393
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,260
PROFESSOR: Yes.

394
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:03,760
Why is that?

395
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

396
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,200
PROFESSOR: Over 1.022 MeV.

397
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,920
Yeah.

398
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,720
Anyone have a question?

399
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,220
No?

400
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,218
OK.

401
00:19:14,218 --> 00:19:16,260
So we've got kind of a
kink in our mass parabola.

402
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:16,790
Yeah?

403
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,165
AUDIENCE: Actually,
yeah, so it's

404
00:19:18,165 --> 00:19:20,777
possible if it's over 1.022,
but it's still very unlikely.

405
00:19:20,777 --> 00:19:21,860
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

406
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,480
AUDIENCE: Until we get to
these higher orders, like 10.

407
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,610
PROFESSOR: Yep, so once
the Q value's satisfied,

408
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,045
it is technically possible.

409
00:19:28,045 --> 00:19:29,670
But if you had
something with the decay

410
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:34,080
energy of, like, 1.023 MeV, it
would be exceedingly unlikely.

411
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,090
So in fact, we can
take a look at this.

412
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,740
This, I would say,
is also going to be

413
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,120
on the exceedingly unlikely
level, and we can take a look.

414
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,030
So if we look at
the decay diagram,

415
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,410
we know it makes positrons.

416
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,010
They're not even really listed.

417
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,810
Interesting.

418
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,910
So that process
would not be allowed,

419
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:55,210
but this one, because
that's about 1.5 MeV,

420
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:55,990
should be allowed.

421
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:59,170
But since that branch
ratio or the probability

422
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:02,020
of that happening is already so
low, I wonder if it even says.

423
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:08,980
Yep, beta ray with a max or
average energy of 482.8 MeV.

424
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,230
We're going to go over why
that energy is so low when

425
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,180
we talk about decay next week.

426
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,700
With the relative intensity of
something with a lot of zeros

427
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,800
before the decimal place.

428
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,480
So there you go.

429
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,100
Like you said, energies near
1.022 MeV, slightly above it,

430
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:29,325
are extremely unlikely but
possible and measurable.

431
00:20:29,325 --> 00:20:30,670
Cool.

432
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:36,420
And then let's see what
could have made argon 40.

433
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:41,290
Could have been beta
decay from chlorine-40.

434
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,060
So chlorine maybe was here.

435
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,450
And I don't think I
have to draw any more.

436
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,570
So we've got a funny-looking
parabola with a kink in it,

437
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,640
because really, you have two
mass parabolas overlapping.

438
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,520
I'm going to go
back to the screen

439
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,290
so that the diagram
from the notes

440
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,980
makes a little more sense.

441
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,980
What we've kind
of traced out here

442
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:09,050
is that there's two
overlapping parabolas here.

443
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,120
There's the one
with the-- what is

444
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,120
it-- the odd Z and the even Z.

445
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,363
So there you go.

446
00:21:15,363 --> 00:21:17,030
Just like the one on
here, which I think

447
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,060
is for a different mass number.

448
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,560
Yep.

449
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,430
102.

450
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:22,810
We get the same kind of behavior
where things will mostly

451
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:26,930
follow the lower mass parabola,
but sometimes if something

452
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:32,110
gets stuck here, it can go
either way to get more stable.

453
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,670
So I want to stop
here for new stuff,

454
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,378
because this is
precisely where I thought

455
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:36,675
we'd be at the end of the week.

456
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:38,050
And in the next
half an hour, I'd

457
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,420
like to open it up to
questions or working things

458
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,520
out together on the
board or anything else

459
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,440
you might have had.

460
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:43,940
Yeah?

461
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,150
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the parabola things.

462
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:46,817
PROFESSOR: Sure.

463
00:21:46,817 --> 00:21:50,480
AUDIENCE: There's-- you
said multiple paths,

464
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,910
so it doesn't have to do the
little peak in the middle?

465
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:56,850
Like, could it follow the
lower parabola or the upper,

466
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,330
or does it have to jump over?

467
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,090
PROFESSOR: It's going
to go in whatever

468
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,230
way makes it more stable.

469
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,147
So you're never going
to have a nucleus that's

470
00:22:04,147 --> 00:22:06,365
going to spontaneously
gain mass in order

471
00:22:06,365 --> 00:22:07,490
to get to a different path.

472
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,720
You can only go down
on the mass axis.

473
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,930
But let's say you happen to be
starting here at potassium-40.

474
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:16,960
You can go down via either
mechanism to the next mass

475
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,289
parabola down.

476
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:21,223
AUDIENCE: But if you were
argon, you would go up.

477
00:22:21,223 --> 00:22:22,690
That's what you would do.

478
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,690
PROFESSOR: That's right.

479
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,180
If you're at argon,
you're stuck.

480
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,490
And in fact, if you
want to take a look,

481
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,980
what do I mean
scientifically by "stuck"?

482
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,810
I mean stable.

483
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:35,380
Argon-40 is a
stable nucleus that

484
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,900
comprises 99.6% of the argon.

485
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,710
So that's what I mean
by "stuck" is stable.

486
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,110
And if we look at the rest
of the table of nuclides

487
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,750
for similar-looking places--

488
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:51,810
so let's hunt near potassium-40.

489
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,410
So notice potassium-40
right here

490
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:57,775
has got stable isotopes to the
upper left and the lower right.

491
00:22:57,775 --> 00:23:01,760
If we look back over
here, manganese-54.

492
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,300
Same deal.

493
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,330
It's got a stable isotope to
the upper left and a stable one

494
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,010
to the lower right.

495
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,740
How much you want to bet that
when we click on manganese-54,

496
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,960
it's got two possible
parent nuclides--

497
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,510
or I'm sorry, two
possible decay methods.

498
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,360
So let's take a look.

499
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:23,750
Manganese-54 can either electron
capture and positron decay

500
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,668
to chromium-54 or
beta decay to iron-54.

501
00:23:27,668 --> 00:23:29,960
Let's take a look at one more
to hammer the point home,

502
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,270
and I think that'll
probably be enough.

503
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:36,160
Cobalt-58 right near
nickel-58 and iron-58.

504
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,020
Interesting.

505
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,902
That one's not allowed unless
there's more down here.

506
00:23:44,902 --> 00:23:46,920
So you can electron
capture to iron-58,

507
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,130
but there's no
allowed decay to--

508
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,510
what was it?

509
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,950
Nickel-58.

510
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,250
OK.

511
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,960
Let's look for more.

512
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:03,200
Chlorine-36 has argon and
sulfur on either side.

513
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,890
There it is.

514
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,353
Beta decay and electron capture.

515
00:24:07,353 --> 00:24:09,520
And how much you want to
bet there's basically never

516
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,290
a positron here?

517
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:15,210
But basically, not
actually never.

518
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:19,110
So you get a positron 0.01%
of the time and electron

519
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,510
capture 1.89% of the time.

520
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:25,540
Where is the other
98-and-change percent?

521
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,710
Right here in the beta decay.

522
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:32,460
So in this case, chlorine-36
will preferentially beta decay.

523
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,510
If you also notice, it's a--

524
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,010
let's see.

525
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,710
I don't know if that
actually matters.

526
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,918
But I am going to say it's
more likely to beta decay.

527
00:24:38,918 --> 00:24:40,710
So when you sum
these up, you get

528
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:43,590
100% of the possible decays.

529
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:47,210
Let's see how many energy
levels there are there too.

530
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,670
Hopefully not too many.

531
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,980
That qualifies as not too many.

532
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,480
Yeah?

533
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,684
Sean?

534
00:24:53,684 --> 00:24:57,530
AUDIENCE: Are the changes
in mass always going

535
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:01,520
to be attributed to
beta decays or electron

536
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,960
captures or positron
[INAUDIBLE]??

537
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,710
PROFESSOR: They'll be
due to those as well

538
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,615
as some other processes, which
we're going to cover on decay.

539
00:25:08,615 --> 00:25:10,240
But if you notice,
I've been giving you

540
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,730
a lot of flash-forwards
in this class.

541
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:15,540
We've introduced
cross-sections as a thing,

542
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,937
the proportionality
constant between interaction

543
00:25:17,937 --> 00:25:18,520
probabilities.

544
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,260
We're going to hit
them hard later.

545
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,510
I've also been kind of
introducing or flash-forwarding

546
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,070
different methods of decay.

547
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,020
So there's also alpha decay.

548
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,470
There's also isomeric
transition or gamma emission.

549
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:32,230
There's also
spontaneous fission.

550
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,790
This is the whole
basis behind how

551
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,650
fission can get working
without some sort

552
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,280
of kick-starting element.

553
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,050
So maybe now's a good
time to show you.

554
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:47,030
Let's go to uranium-235
and see how it decays.

555
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:51,740
It goes alpha decay to
thorium-231 most of the time.

556
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:55,340
And if you look how,
it's not terrible.

557
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,480
We can make sense of this.

558
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:04,000
It also undergoes SF, which
stands for spontaneous fission.

559
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,130
So one out of every seven--

560
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,010
what is it?

561
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:12,550
Seven out of every
billion times,

562
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:16,540
it will just spontaneously
fizz into two fission products.

563
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,540
And this is why if you put
enough uranium-235 together

564
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,780
in one place, you can
make a critical reactor.

565
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,280
In reality, you
don't tend to want

566
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:29,560
to put enough U-235 together to
just spontaneously go critical.

567
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,740
We use other isotopes
as kickstarters.

568
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,770
For example, californium,
I think it's 252.

569
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,910
Let's take a quick look.

570
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,520
There we go.

571
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,310
Californium-252 undergoes
spontaneous fission 3%

572
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:44,810
of the time.

573
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,730
It's even heavier,
even more unstable.

574
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,850
So there is a
reactor called HFIR,

575
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:53,210
or the high flux isotope reactor
at Oak Ridge National Lab.

576
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,850
One of its main outputs is
californium kickstarters

577
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:56,950
for reactors.

578
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,930
So to get things going, you
put a little bit of californium

579
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:02,930
in as a gigantic neutron source,
and then you don't really

580
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,787
need it anymore
once it gets going.

581
00:27:04,787 --> 00:27:06,620
So it's one of the safer
ways of starting up

582
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,470
a reactor is put in a
crazy neutron source,

583
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,150
and then once it gets going,
take it out or leave it in

584
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:12,650
and burn it.

585
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,410
I'm not actually sure
which one they do.

586
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:14,988
Yep?

587
00:27:14,988 --> 00:27:16,482
AUDIENCE: Is the
name californium

588
00:27:16,482 --> 00:27:18,480
based on California?

589
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,753
PROFESSOR: It is.

590
00:27:19,753 --> 00:27:20,420
When we get to--

591
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,753
now is a good time to introduce
the super heavy elements

592
00:27:22,753 --> 00:27:24,000
since you asked.

593
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,150
So a lot of these older
elements were named after--

594
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,940
actually this is kind
of a hobby of mine.

595
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,490
So I don't know if you guys
saw the periodic table outside.

596
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,098
I collect elements,
because if you're

597
00:27:34,098 --> 00:27:35,640
going to collect
something, you might

598
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,280
as well collect everything that
everything else is made of.

599
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,670
It's the same reason I
went into nuclear energy.

600
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:45,210
I started off course 6, or
6.1, specifically electrical.

601
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,430
And I was like, well, I
could be designing, like,

602
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,270
the next screen
for a cell phone,

603
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,218
or we could solve
the energy problem,

604
00:27:51,218 --> 00:27:53,260
which is the problem all
others are based off of.

605
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,770
So my whole life theme
has been go to the source.

606
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,620
That's why I came here in
high school and never left.

607
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,540
That's why I declared course 22.

608
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,060
That's why I collect
elements and probably is

609
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,940
the reason for many other things
which only a psychiatrist could

610
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,460
diagnose.

611
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,860
But let's look at some
of the other elements.

612
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,040
For example, yttrium.

613
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,480
I think it has a isotope 40.

614
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,170
Anyone know-- no, it
doesn't have a 40.

615
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,935
What about a 50?

616
00:28:20,935 --> 00:28:21,435
60?

617
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,520
100?

618
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,900
Whatever.

619
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,850
At least it knew
that Y was yttrium.

620
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:29,540
Anyone know--

621
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,082
AUDIENCE: 89.

622
00:28:30,082 --> 00:28:31,707
PROFESSOR: --where
this is coming from?

623
00:28:31,707 --> 00:28:32,870
89?

624
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:33,605
Seems high.

625
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:36,930
Oh my god.

626
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:37,472
You're right.

627
00:28:37,472 --> 00:28:38,560
AUDIENCE: I work with it.

628
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,700
PROFESSOR: OK.

629
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,200
Gotcha.

630
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,640
You work with it.

631
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,180
Awesome.

632
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,958
Anyone know what this
is all about, yttrium?

633
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,510
There's a town called
Ytterby in Sweden

634
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:53,720
where large deposits of
yttrium and ytterbium, or Yb,

635
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,730
tend to be found or
Db, named for dubnium.

636
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,600
So let's say the really
basic elements tend

637
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,530
to come from Latin.

638
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,730
Fe stands for iron, which
actually stands for ferrum.

639
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:04,700
Lead is plumbum.

640
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,140
Gold is aurum.

641
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,707
Silver, Ag, is argentium.

642
00:29:07,707 --> 00:29:09,290
I don't know if I'm
saying that right.

643
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,707
I never took Latin,
and I've never

644
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,402
heard it spoken, of course.

645
00:29:13,402 --> 00:29:15,860
And then a lot of the heavier
and heavier elements as we go

646
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,527
are being named for
more and more famous

647
00:29:17,527 --> 00:29:21,860
scientists or places where
they tend to be made like Db.

648
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,260
I'm going to guess
260 for a mass there.

649
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,700
Oh, nice.

650
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,730
For Dubna in Russia
that has got one

651
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:32,690
of the few gigantic super heavy
element colliders where they're

652
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:35,585
constantly synthesizing
and characterizing

653
00:29:35,585 --> 00:29:36,710
these super heavy elements.

654
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,247
So finally they
said, you know what?

655
00:29:38,247 --> 00:29:39,830
They've made enough
of these in Dubna.

656
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,840
Let's name one of the
elements after them.

657
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,690
Or Sg, seaborgium,
for Glenn Seaborg.

658
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:48,920
Or No, nobelium,
for Alfred Nobel.

659
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,538
Yep?

660
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:53,740
AUDIENCE: I just have a question
for the actual mass parabola.

661
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,490
PROFESSOR: Uh-huh.

662
00:29:57,412 --> 00:30:03,142
AUDIENCE: Like, do the parabolas
ever, like, reach each other?

663
00:30:03,142 --> 00:30:04,350
PROFESSOR: Do they intersect?

664
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:04,980
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

665
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,350
PROFESSOR: I've never seen
a case where they intersect.

666
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,440
That would make for a
crazy situation indeed.

667
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,050
However, part of what the
homework assignment's about

668
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:16,710
is to derive an analytical
form for a mass parabola

669
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:19,360
and then check the data
to see how well it works.

670
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,710
So for any cases where you
have an even mass number,

671
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:26,130
and you have either odd-odd
or even-even nuclei,

672
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,260
you can check those
equations analytically

673
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,547
to see if they'll intersect.

674
00:30:30,547 --> 00:30:33,956
AUDIENCE: And for the
case of A equals 40,

675
00:30:33,956 --> 00:30:38,350
I'm not really sure what
the top parabola is.

676
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,410
PROFESSOR: So the top
parabola for potassium-40--

677
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:44,160
let's take a quick look at how
many protons and neutrons it

678
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,330
has.

679
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:48,720
Potassium has a proton
number of 19, which means

680
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,820
it has a neutron number of 21.

681
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:57,430
So the top parabola
is odd N and odd Z,

682
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:05,040
where the bottom one
is even N and even Z.

683
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,140
Whereas for odd
mass number nuclei,

684
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,560
it has to be either
odd-even or even-odd,

685
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,440
else it would be even, which
is a funny sentence when

686
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,170
you say it all out loud.

687
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:15,670
Yeah.

688
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,770
So that's the idea
here is that notice

689
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:22,330
that the even-even parabola
tends to be further down.

690
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:26,920
All those nuclear magic
numbers, 2, 8, 20, 28--

691
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,340
I'm not going to quote the rest.

692
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,860
Those the little ones I know.

693
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,570
All even numbers.

694
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,070
So any other questions
on these mass

695
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,300
parabolas before we launch
into super heavy elements?

696
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:36,800
Yeah?

697
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the bump on the right?

698
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,580
PROFESSOR: Uh-huh.

699
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,606
AUDIENCE: How do you know
that that's where [INAUDIBLE]??

700
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,150
PROFESSOR: Analytically
or experimentally?

701
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:47,775
Which question?

702
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:49,530
AUDIENCE: Analytically.

703
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:50,970
PROFESSOR: So analytically.

704
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:54,780
Analytically there
should be some isotope

705
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,370
of-- well, not potassium.

706
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,460
That wouldn't be allowed.

707
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,530
So in this case, the
stable element positions

708
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:04,330
have got to kind of switch
off, shouldn't they?

709
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:08,430
So if that's potassium-40,
that would still

710
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,898
have to be potassium.

711
00:32:10,898 --> 00:32:12,440
You don't really
have another choice.

712
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,655
There isn't really a position
there, is there, analytically?

713
00:32:15,655 --> 00:32:17,780
That's the interesting
thing is that you can either

714
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:21,830
be odd-odd or even-even
for an even mass number.

715
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,880
But you can't just take off
one neutron from potassium-40,

716
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,430
and then you've
got potassium-39.

717
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:30,110
Then you're on a
different mass number.

718
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,810
Or if you exchange a
proton and a neutron,

719
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:35,340
which you pretty much do in
either of these directions.

720
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,363
There's no way to get
straight down here.

721
00:32:38,363 --> 00:32:39,113
AUDIENCE: Right.

722
00:32:39,113 --> 00:32:39,780
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

723
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,230
AUDIENCE: For odd-odd,
delta is negative, right?

724
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,230
PROFESSOR: For odd what?

725
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:43,850
For-- sorry?

726
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,650
AUDIENCE: For odd-odd,
delta is negative?

727
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,483
PROFESSOR: Yeah, let's
go back to that slide

728
00:32:47,483 --> 00:32:49,520
just to make sure.

729
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,470
You mean the pairing term in
the semi-empirical mass formula?

730
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,115
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

731
00:32:53,115 --> 00:32:54,740
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
for odd-odd nuclei,

732
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:58,580
indeed, delta's negative, which
means lower binding energy,

733
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,720
which means higher mass.

734
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,260
And that's why we see it bump
up on the mass right here.

735
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,393
Yeah?

736
00:33:05,393 --> 00:33:07,310
And do you have a second
part of the question?

737
00:33:10,286 --> 00:33:14,750
AUDIENCE: It was
more so how to relate

738
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:20,932
[INAUDIBLE] like the binding
energy to that mass parabola.

739
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,390
PROFESSOR: We can
actually relate--

740
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,848
so we can relate
the binding energy

741
00:33:23,848 --> 00:33:27,130
to the mass and the mass
parabola analytically,

742
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:35,080
because the binding energy is
equal to Z times protons plus N

743
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:40,420
times mass of neutron
minus the actual mass

744
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:45,920
of that same nucleus, A comma
Z. So they're actually directly

745
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,740
related, just negatively.

746
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,720
So something with
a higher mass is

747
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,300
going to have a low binding
energy, which means it's

748
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,030
less bound and less stable.

749
00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:00,180
And indeed, the further
up the mass scale we go,

750
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,690
the higher those
beta or electron

751
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,757
capture or positron
energies are.

752
00:34:04,757 --> 00:34:06,590
And there's another
thing you can check too,

753
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,150
which is the half-life.

754
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,760
Half-life is what we'll be
talking about on Tuesday.

755
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,000
It's how long before an
average amount of a substance

756
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,125
has undergone radioactive decay.

757
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,750
So let's look at some
of these isotopes

758
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,790
and start looking
at half-life trends

759
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,980
as another measure of stability.

760
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:26,900
So potassium-40 has an
exceptionally long half-life.

761
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,330
So it's relatively stable.

762
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:31,820
Let's take a look not at
either the stable isotopes,

763
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,530
but let's go up
the mass parabola

764
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,940
chain in one direction.

765
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,300
Calcium-40, scandium-40.

766
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:42,050
So let's take a
look at scandium-40.

767
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:47,659
Scandium-40 has a half-life
less than a second.

768
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:51,889
And it's got quite a high
decay energy by whatever method

769
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,840
you want to use.

770
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,555
Let's go up to titanium-40.

771
00:34:56,555 --> 00:34:57,430
Anyone want to guess?

772
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:01,400
Do you think the half-life
is going to go up or down?

773
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,460
Let's see if the
half-life goes down.

774
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:07,610
We know the decay
energy goes up.

775
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,420
Indeed.

776
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,390
Half-life goes down from
182 milliseconds to 50

777
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,040
milliseconds.

778
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,250
And let's say titanium-40
could have come from-- wow.

779
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:23,770
Two proton decay from Cr-42 with
a half-life of 350 nanoseconds.

780
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:28,680
So as we go up the mass ladder
and down the stability ladder,

781
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,940
the half-life decreases, which
kind of follows intuitively.

782
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,560
Something that's
exceptionally stable

783
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,548
should have a
half-life of infinity,

784
00:35:36,548 --> 00:35:38,340
and something that's
exceptionally unstable

785
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,345
should just blow
apart instantly.

786
00:35:40,345 --> 00:35:41,970
Like, remember the
first week of class,

787
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:45,600
we talked about helium-4
grabbing a neutron,

788
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,420
becoming helium-5, and
instantaneously going back

789
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,200
to helium-4.

790
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:55,630
If you look at
helium-5, its half-life

791
00:35:55,630 --> 00:36:00,970
is measured in MeV, or 7 times
10 to the minus 7 femtoseconds.

792
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:03,100
So if helium-4
absorbs a neutron,

793
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,830
it simply doesn't want
it and gets rid of it

794
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,790
in 10 to the minus 7
femtoseconds, which

795
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,785
would tell us that it's
exceptionally unstable.

796
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:16,900
So I hope that's a
long-winded answer

797
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,170
to that question about what
does it mean to be going up

798
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,250
in the mass levels.

799
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,890
Any other questions on mass
parabolas or the liquid drop

800
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:29,320
model or stability in general?

801
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,100
Yes.

802
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,012
AUDIENCE: For something that
goes upwards [INAUDIBLE]

803
00:36:33,012 --> 00:36:35,377
just because the
mass [INAUDIBLE]..

804
00:36:38,627 --> 00:36:40,460
PROFESSOR: So if you're
changing one neutron

805
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,820
to a proton in each case,
you're switching back and forth

806
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:47,630
from the odd-odd to the
even-even mass parabolas.

807
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,690
So if I were to redraw
these dots more to scale,

808
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:54,800
this would have to
be on the odd-odd.

809
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,400
And, well, let me draw
them a little better.

810
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,090
Yep.

811
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,050
AUDIENCE: OK.

812
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,330
PROFESSOR: That's
on the odd-odd,

813
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:03,810
and that's on the even-even.

814
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:04,770
AUDIENCE: OK.

815
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:05,600
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

816
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,460
So excuse my poor
drawing skills.

817
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,340
But if you're switching
one proton to a neutron

818
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,370
or vice-versa, by
definition, you're

819
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:17,330
jumping back and forth
between these parabolas.

820
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,330
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

821
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,497
PROFESSOR: That's a good
question for clarification.

822
00:37:20,497 --> 00:37:21,530
You had a question too?

823
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,635
AUDIENCE: Yeah, about the
semi-empirical mass formula.

824
00:37:24,635 --> 00:37:28,112
When do you use that to find
binding energy as opposed

825
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:29,445
to, like, any of the other ways?

826
00:37:31,785 --> 00:37:32,660
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry.

827
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,550
The semi-empirical mass
formula is a good way

828
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:37,880
to get an analytical
guess at most of them.

829
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,680
If you want an
exact answer, always

830
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,420
use the actual binding energy.

831
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:45,890
AUDIENCE: So, like, how
often is it used now?

832
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,758
PROFESSOR: I would not say
it's used much now except--

833
00:37:48,758 --> 00:37:51,050
well, that's going to be one
of your homework questions

834
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:55,460
is this formula predicts that
as you get heavier and heavier

835
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:59,720
and heavier, nuclei should just
continuously get less stable.

836
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,180
And that was, as of
when this was derived,

837
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:06,410
let's say decades ago, we
now know something different

838
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,683
is happening.

839
00:38:07,683 --> 00:38:09,350
So if you look at the
table of nuclides,

840
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:13,580
you can sort of see some swells
in the number of black pixels

841
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,350
until it cuts off.

842
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:18,320
And this region actually where
we think super heavy elements

843
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,160
happen, I want to jump to the
actual table of nuclides, which

844
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,180
I'll say is our snapshot
of knowledge today,

845
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,210
and go all the way to the top.

846
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:33,530
And our knowledge kind of cuts
off at these elements, which

847
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:38,030
are, for now, temporarily
named in a very uncreative way.

848
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,260
We don't even know
anything about them.

849
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:43,430
Uun is probably going to
have a proton number of what?

850
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,620
110.

851
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,330
I don't know what
the prefixes are,

852
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:50,150
but UUU would be un-un-un 111.

853
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:54,010
Probably has 111 protons.

854
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:58,540
Beyond here, off the screen or
probably up into the next room,

855
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:02,110
it's predicted that once you
approach the next magic number

856
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:05,110
in nuclei, there should
be an island of stability

857
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,847
where it may not necessarily
be totally stable,

858
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:09,430
but the half-lives
should go up again.

859
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,160
And we should be able to
synthesize super heavy matter.

860
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,400
And if you actually
graph neutron number

861
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,260
versus half-life-- so notice
how we were looking at half-life

862
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,000
as a measure of stability.

863
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,730
It starts to go up, then
comes down, and then,

864
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,590
to the extent of
our knowledge, it

865
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:27,400
is going back up again to the
next predicted magic number.

866
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,530
So what we think
should be happening

867
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,820
is half-lives should be
continuously going up.

868
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,320
And yeah?

869
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,112
You had a question?

870
00:39:33,112 --> 00:39:35,960
AUDIENCE: Like, what do we
do with these weird things?

871
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,570
PROFESSOR: Well,
whatever you want.

872
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:39,520
It's going to be--

873
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,850
it should be dense as all heck,
because nuclear matter is quite

874
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,290
a bit denser than
ordinary matter,

875
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:47,030
and quite a bit is
quite an understatement.

876
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:49,450
So what would you do
with super heavy matter?

877
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:52,150
A lot of it could be used to
probe the structure of matter.

878
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,100
There's a lot about
how the nucleus is

879
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,410
constructed that we don't know.

880
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:57,940
And beyond the
scope of this course

881
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,732
would also be an understatement.

882
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:01,690
There's folks that are
making their careers now

883
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,570
on figuring out what are
the forces between nucleons?

884
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:08,440
Why do things spontaneously
fizz at the rates that they do?

885
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,230
You'll even hit a little
bit of this in 22.02

886
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:14,740
when you can calculate the rough
half-life for alpha decay using

887
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:20,480
quantum tunneling through the
potential barrier in a nucleus.

888
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,750
And so the more nuclei we
have to mess around with,

889
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:25,540
the more data and real
examples we have to study.

890
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,390
But practical applications,
well, I could imagine,

891
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,830
we might find something
denser than osmium.

892
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:33,910
Osmium right now has a
density of about 22 grams

893
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,390
per cubic centimeter.

894
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:38,740
This stuff, zirconium,
is about 6.9 or so.

895
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,030
Steel is like 8.

896
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,140
Lead's like 11.

897
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,700
Mercury is like 19.

898
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,900
Have any of you ever played
with liquid mercury before?

899
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,510
This is a "don't try this at
home, kids" kind of moment.

900
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,190
My grandfather happened
to be a dentist,

901
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:54,110
so we happened to have a lot
of mercury to mess around with.

902
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:56,170
And it's, like,
unintuitively heavy.

903
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,250
It's unbelievable.

904
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,810
A 1-pound jar is about that big.

905
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,310
I think it would
be cool if we could

906
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:04,710
find something even denser.

907
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,300
And then really,
really dense matter

908
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,390
happens to make really, really
good photon shields and gamma--

909
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,390
not the Star Trek thing.

910
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:13,410
I mean this in the actual
nuclear physics sense.

911
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:16,260
The best way to stop gamma
rays for gamma shielding

912
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,420
is just put more
matter in front of it.

913
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:22,290
And if we find a denser state
of matter that's earth stable,

914
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:25,493
you then have a
smaller gamma shield.

915
00:41:25,493 --> 00:41:27,660
So there are practical
applications too in radiation

916
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,560
shielding.

917
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,863
They also might make
awesome nuclear fuel,

918
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,280
because you better
believe they're

919
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,110
going to fizz like crazy.

920
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:35,830
So who knows?

921
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:39,130
Maybe we can-- I don't think
that would be cost-effective,

922
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,050
but it would probably work.

923
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:44,290
So the way they're
doing this is actually

924
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:50,320
slamming calcium 48 nuclei
into other super heavy elements

925
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,730
that have exceptionally
long half-lives.

926
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,640
So if you can't read
what the screen says,

927
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,820
this here is berkelium,
for Berkeley,

928
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:01,600
with proton number
97, mass number 249.

929
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:08,450
Let's take a look at the
Bk-249, which happens

930
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:10,020
to be way beyond uranium.

931
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,710
So it's definitely
not a stable isotope,

932
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:15,890
but it has a
half-life of 320 days.

933
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:17,720
That means you can
make a bunch of it,

934
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,840
chemically separate it,
make it into a target,

935
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,110
and fire calcium-48
nuclei into it.

936
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:27,680
Anyone want to guess,
why do we use calcium-48?

937
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,525
And I'll give you a hint
and write the proton number

938
00:42:30,525 --> 00:42:31,025
for calcium.

939
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:40,230
The isotope that we
use is calcium-28--

940
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,090
or calcium-48.

941
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:43,830
Anyone want to take a guess?

942
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:45,970
Why start here?

943
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:48,570
Why not just smash two
berkeliums into each other?

944
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:56,130
Calcium 48 happens to
be exceptionally stable,

945
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:57,930
because it's got
two magic numbers.

946
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:01,560
Its proton number is 20, one
of those peaks of stability.

947
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,200
And its neutron number is 28.

948
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,200
So start with
something super stable,

949
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,290
something with a lot more
binding energy to begin with,

950
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,600
and you maximize your
chance of making something

951
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,210
with more binding energy
that won't just spontaneously

952
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:16,110
disappear.

953
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:18,630
So there are reasons
calcium 48 was chosen

954
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,475
and not something
heavier or lighter.

955
00:43:20,475 --> 00:43:22,050
If we go back to
that article, you

956
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:25,650
can see what happens here is
you make some element 117, which

957
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:30,300
has yet to be made, and it
undergoes alpha decay until it

958
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,840
reaches some rather stable--

959
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,580
you know, 17 seconds.

960
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,080
That's pretty exceptional.

961
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,170
And if you notice the
trends here, as you decay,

962
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:43,710
the alpha energy
steadily goes down,

963
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:46,350
and the half-life
steadily goes up.

964
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:49,560
And so what you do is you make
a super, super heavy element,

965
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,930
hoping that it
will decay and rest

966
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:54,210
in one of these
islands of stability

967
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:58,630
beyond the magic numbers
that we know right now.

968
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:00,130
Which I thought
this was super cool,

969
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:02,203
because this is
actually happening now.

970
00:44:02,203 --> 00:44:03,370
Like, new elements are made.

971
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:05,200
I think we've been
seeing one a year

972
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,867
or so for the past
few years on average.

973
00:44:06,867 --> 00:44:09,242
There might have been a year
when there was more than one

974
00:44:09,242 --> 00:44:10,437
announced recently.

975
00:44:10,437 --> 00:44:12,520
There's only a few places
in the world doing them,

976
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,430
but you can start to-- already
with two weeks of 22.01,

977
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:17,650
you can start to
get a handle for why

978
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:20,410
do they use the nuclei they do,
and then what sort of things

979
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:21,790
are you looking for?

980
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:24,040
Decays with lower
and lower energy

981
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,590
mean you're already starting
to get less steep on whatever

982
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:29,057
imaginary mass parabola.

983
00:44:29,057 --> 00:44:30,640
Don't quite know how
to draw this one,

984
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,710
because it's beyond
anything we know.

985
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,780
And as the half-lives
keep going up,

986
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:39,350
you can tell that it's reaching
a measure of stability.

987
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:41,750
However, to get you
started on the homework,

988
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,453
for the open-ended
ended problem--

989
00:44:43,453 --> 00:44:44,870
I think I'll bring
it up right now

990
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:46,037
so you guys can take a look.

991
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:53,420
So let's go to the Stellar site.

992
00:45:00,802 --> 00:45:02,010
Hopefully it doesn't call me.

993
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:02,510
Good.

994
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:09,017
And two problem set two.

995
00:45:09,017 --> 00:45:10,600
This is the way I
know that everyone's

996
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,100
seen the P set seven days before
it's due, because I'm going

997
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:17,270
to put it up on the
screen so you can

998
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:20,070
see it all the way at the end.

999
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:23,710
Predicting the
island of stability.

1000
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:25,690
Does the semi-empirical
mass formula

1001
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:28,420
predict the island of stability?

1002
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,670
Well, let's start you
off with the easier

1003
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,500
part of the question,
which is yes or no.

1004
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,840
And I'm going to leave you
to the why and the how.

1005
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:41,050
If we graph binding energy per
nucleon versus mass number,

1006
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:48,050
the semi-empirical mass formula
predicts something like this.

1007
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:51,200
What happens as we go beyond
the realm of known mass numbers?

1008
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:56,640
Anyone?

1009
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,342
How should I extend this curve?

1010
00:46:01,952 --> 00:46:02,910
What did you say, Alex?

1011
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:03,700
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

1012
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:04,825
PROFESSOR: Just keep going.

1013
00:46:04,825 --> 00:46:06,330
Yeah.

1014
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:10,750
Does this predict an
island of stability?

1015
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,190
I don't think so.

1016
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:14,290
So that's one of the
few questions I'm

1017
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:15,970
asking you in this homework.

1018
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:17,320
And it's up to you guys.

1019
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,340
Use your creativity.

1020
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,020
Again, this is an
open-ended problem.

1021
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,330
I'm not looking for
a specific answer.

1022
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:24,220
I want to see how
you think and how

1023
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:27,130
you would change this
formula to account

1024
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:30,130
and actually predict the
island of stability while still

1025
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:33,550
satisfying the mostly correct
predictions from the elements

1026
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:36,330
we know.

1027
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:37,906
So-- sorry, go ahead.

1028
00:46:37,906 --> 00:46:43,860
AUDIENCE: So should it,
like, converge a little bit?

1029
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:46,170
PROFESSOR: Well, you're
on the right track.

1030
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,670
If you want to show
stability, you'd

1031
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:51,300
want it to maybe have a
higher value right here.

1032
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,700
Higher binding
energy per nucleon

1033
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,460
would correspond to a
lower mass, which would

1034
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,560
correspond to higher stability.

1035
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:04,742
So how would you predict
this island of stability?

1036
00:47:04,742 --> 00:47:06,450
And then more
specifically, how would you

1037
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:12,150
reconcile the inaccuracies
in the semi-empirical mass

1038
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:12,990
formula?

1039
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:15,463
Because we know it doesn't
work very well for all cases.

1040
00:47:15,463 --> 00:47:17,880
There are some cases like right
around here where it works

1041
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,120
great, and there's some like
right here and right here where

1042
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:21,870
it really doesn't.

1043
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:24,390
You can get things
wrong by like 10 MeV,

1044
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:26,750
which is pretty significant.

1045
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:29,288
You know, that's like four
digits on the mass scale, like,

1046
00:47:29,288 --> 00:47:30,330
the fourth decimal place.

1047
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:31,747
That's huge to a
nuclear engineer.

1048
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:36,260
So that's something
to get thinking about.

1049
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,300
And remember I did tell
you that there will

1050
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,220
be some open-ended problems.

1051
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,720
I'm going to mark
them as open-ended

1052
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,310
so you actually know.

1053
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:45,360
We're not looking for a
right or wrong answer.

1054
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,150
This is one of those
kinds of things

1055
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:49,130
where we want to
see how you think

1056
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:50,960
and what do you
think is missing.

1057
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,350
There's other hard problems
where we give you the answer,

1058
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:57,080
because I'm not interested
in you deriving some insane

1059
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,750
expression and getting it right.

1060
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:02,300
I'm interested in the
derivation process.

1061
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,070
What are the steps you choose?

1062
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:05,630
What sort of
assumptions do you make?

1063
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:08,120
What sort of terms can
you neglect and say,

1064
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,650
that's in the ninth
decimal place.

1065
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:11,223
I'm going to forget it.

1066
00:48:11,223 --> 00:48:12,890
So in this case, we
give you the answer,

1067
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,740
because we're going to
grade you on the process.

1068
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:18,050
And you can use the answer
to check your process

1069
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:21,200
and see if you're on
the right track or not.

1070
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,520
For the skill-building
questions,

1071
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,990
we actually do
want you to come up

1072
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:29,400
with some sort of an
answer like explaining

1073
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,250
the terms in the
semi-empirical mass formula

1074
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:35,010
or modifying an equation to
calculate something else.

1075
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:37,150
We will be looking for
a right answer there.

1076
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:39,025
But those are questions
to make sure that you

1077
00:48:39,025 --> 00:48:40,350
get the basics of the material.

1078
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,960
If you can answer all of the
questions in the first half

1079
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,990
of these P sets fairly quickly,
let's say in three or four

1080
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:48,810
hours, you're totally
on the right track.

1081
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:52,280
The hard ones is
because this is MIT.

1082
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,780
And we want you to
think beyond just

1083
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,360
knowing what's in the
Turner book or the Yit book.

1084
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,760
Like I said, you guys are
the leaders of this field.

1085
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,564
So any other questions
on stability in general?

1086
00:49:03,564 --> 00:49:04,064
Yes?

1087
00:49:04,064 --> 00:49:06,494
AUDIENCE: Just a
real quick reminder.

1088
00:49:06,494 --> 00:49:08,230
When you say, like,
even-even, are you

1089
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:09,680
talking protons, neutrons?

1090
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,700
PROFESSOR: Correct.

1091
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,640
So that would be even
N and even Z or odd N

1092
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,350
and odd Z like in
the reading and like

1093
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:18,440
on these mass parabolas.

1094
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:18,940
Yep.

1095
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:20,410
Any other questions?

1096
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:23,710
Yes.

1097
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,990
AUDIENCE: Is the
only proof or reason

1098
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:28,126
that we say that there's
an island of stability

1099
00:49:28,126 --> 00:49:33,637
because the mass increases
up to the point of unknown?

1100
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,720
PROFESSOR: There's a few--

1101
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,883
so the question was,
is the only reason

1102
00:49:36,883 --> 00:49:39,550
people think there will be super
heavy elements because the mass

1103
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:40,360
increases, right?

1104
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,260
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1105
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:44,350
PROFESSOR: So in this case,
the mass will always--

1106
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:47,150
are you talking about
now the total mass or--

1107
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,696
AUDIENCE: Why is
the idea that there

1108
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:51,317
is this island of stability?

1109
00:49:51,317 --> 00:49:52,520
PROFESSOR: Ah, OK.

1110
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,978
AUDIENCE: If this
doesn't prove it,

1111
00:49:53,978 --> 00:49:57,250
do we have other
reasons [INAUDIBLE]??

1112
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:59,260
PROFESSOR: We have a
few things to go on.

1113
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:03,520
There are a number of different
aspects of nuclear stability

1114
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,010
that are all pointing
to the same conclusion.

1115
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:08,140
One of them, you can
see on this graph here.

1116
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:10,180
If you look at the
alpha decay half-life

1117
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,070
as a function of
neutron number, it

1118
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:15,400
doesn't just increase or
decrease monotonically.

1119
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,470
It swells up and down.

1120
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:20,770
And it reaches a
relative maximum

1121
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:22,690
near certain magic numbers.

1122
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:26,110
We can confirm that with
the lower mass nuclei.

1123
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:27,640
It doesn't work for
really low mass,

1124
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:31,210
because tiny things don't
tend to undergo alpha decay.

1125
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:33,760
But there are patterns
that we're simply

1126
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,930
recognizing and saying, well, if
this is the next magic number,

1127
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:39,590
it should continue to increase.

1128
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:43,600
And I should mention too,
this scale is logarithmic.

1129
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,900
So the top right here is
like 10 to the 4 seconds.

1130
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,930
Just so you know, there
are 86,400 seconds

1131
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:52,060
in-- what is it-- a day.

1132
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:55,340
And 3 times 10 to the
7 seconds in a year.

1133
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,430
So if this graph--

1134
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:59,370
let's say for Z 111--

1135
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:02,280
were to continue
on its track, it

1136
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,500
should reach like
10 to the 9 or 10

1137
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:08,160
to the 10, which could be
like 100-year lifetimes

1138
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,920
or 100-year half-lives,
which means definitely you

1139
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,470
can chemically separate them
and do things with them.

1140
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:16,350
I don't know if they would
be safe enough to deal with.

1141
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:18,790
But we also don't really
know what's going to happen.

1142
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:21,450
You can see that there
is some uncertainty,

1143
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:23,460
and things don't always
follow the trend.

1144
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:26,580
Even the error bars are
outside the dashed lines.

1145
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:27,810
But so we have this to go on.

1146
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:31,260
We have the alpha
decay half-life.

1147
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,630
We also have the
alpha decay energy.

1148
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:35,790
As you approach an
island of stability,

1149
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:37,860
something that's more
stable won't give off

1150
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:40,830
as much kinetic energy
to its alpha particle.

1151
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:44,520
There is also-- for the
ones that you can actually

1152
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,320
measure that live
long enough, you

1153
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,570
can measure their
mass to charge ratio

1154
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:51,990
and actually get a good
picture of their actual mass.

1155
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:55,290
So we would expect
the mass defect

1156
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:58,650
to follow a certain
trend as we go up.

1157
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:00,240
The mass is always
going to increase.

1158
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,600
If you add more nucleons,
it's going to increase.

1159
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,800
But the mass defect,
which is the real mass

1160
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,920
minus the atomic number mass--

1161
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,690
if stability were
to increase, do you

1162
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:15,730
think the mass defect
would increase or decrease

1163
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:17,404
with more stability?

1164
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:23,850
Let's take a quick look at this.

1165
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:29,730
If A were to stay the same,
a shrinking real mass--

1166
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,550
and remember, lower mass
means more stability--

1167
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:38,050
would mean a higher
or a low mass defect?

1168
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:42,520
It would mean a lower mass
defect or a lower excess mass

1169
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,880
as you'd call it.

1170
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:48,070
So in this case, you would
expect the mass of the nucleus

1171
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:53,960
to be smaller than its A if
it was going more stable.

1172
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,060
And all of these trends
work in the same direction,

1173
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:00,230
which is saying, OK, so
we have the alpha energy.

1174
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:01,610
We have the mass defect.

1175
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:04,580
We have the half-life all
pointing to the same thing

1176
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:07,250
that something should
be more stable.

1177
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,050
And we have some
patterns to go on,

1178
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:12,470
but our understanding
is kind of incomplete.

1179
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:14,700
So-- yeah?

1180
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:18,220
AUDIENCE: So if there's
super heavy elements,

1181
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,810
do they exist
somewhere in space,

1182
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:21,365
or do stars make them, possibly?

1183
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:21,990
PROFESSOR: Ooh.

1184
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:22,960
AUDIENCE: Or are they--

1185
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,756
PROFESSOR: Good question.

1186
00:53:24,756 --> 00:53:26,798
AUDIENCE: --currently made?

1187
00:53:26,798 --> 00:53:29,340
PROFESSOR: So the question is,
if super heavy elements exist,

1188
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,410
do they exist out
there in space?

1189
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:34,560
I think there would be a
couple places they would exist.

1190
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,950
The source of most of
the elements beyond iron

1191
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:42,660
is supernovas, where regular old
fusion doesn't cut it anymore.

1192
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:47,700
When you hit the maximum of
this binding energy per nucleon

1193
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,370
curve, you're at about iron 56.

1194
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:52,530
That's why stars tend
to form a core of iron

1195
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:55,560
before it goes really
bad in whatever way it

1196
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,610
does for a star.

1197
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:58,440
There are multiple ways.

1198
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,980
When you get a supernova,
you have an insane explosion,

1199
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,600
and the core gets
compressed from

1200
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:08,130
the outside, forcing fusion
of heavy elements to happen.

1201
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:10,720
That's because you're putting
in extra kinetic energy.

1202
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,970
So it's like you have an
endothermic reaction where

1203
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:19,020
if Q is less than zero, how do
you make that reaction happen?

1204
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:21,240
Add kinetic energy,
which can come

1205
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,690
from a tremendous explosion
outside of the outer regions

1206
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:26,128
of the star.

1207
00:54:26,128 --> 00:54:28,420
So who's to say that some of
these super heavy elements

1208
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,010
aren't formed in supernovas?

1209
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:31,820
I think they would be.

1210
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:35,163
But would they actually make
it out to be part of Earth

1211
00:54:35,163 --> 00:54:37,580
and then, let's say, live the
5 billion years that Earth's

1212
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,510
been around?

1213
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:41,290
We don't know if their
half-lives are long enough.

1214
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:44,940
There very well may have
been some 5 billion years ago

1215
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:46,880
or when the supernova was made.

1216
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,490
But we haven't detected
any here on Earth.

1217
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:53,760
So we know that they're
not 5 billion years stable.

1218
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,140
Rather, I wouldn't
even say we know that,

1219
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:58,790
but we have a pretty good idea.

1220
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:01,932
That's a great question is
like, are they naturally made?

1221
00:55:01,932 --> 00:55:04,412
Probably.

1222
00:55:04,412 --> 00:55:06,400
Yeah.

1223
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,020
Any other questions?

1224
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:09,940
I like these outside
the material ones.

1225
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:13,810
We can take things beyond
our known universe,

1226
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,960
start to explain them.
