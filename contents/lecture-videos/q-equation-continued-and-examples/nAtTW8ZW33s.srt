00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,690
MICHAEL SHORT: So I want
to do a quick review

9
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,773
of what we did last time,
because I know I threw--

10
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:29,550
I think we threw the full six
boards of math and physics

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,600
at you guys.

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,240
We started off
trying to describe

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,830
this general situation.

14
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,870
If you have a small nucleus 1
firing at a large nucleus 2,

15
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,380
something happens, and we
didn't specify what that was.

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,690
A potentially
different nucleus 3

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,080
could come shooting
off at angle theta,

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,690
and a potentially different
nucleus 4 goes off

19
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,113
at a different angle phi.

20
00:00:53,113 --> 00:00:55,530
Just to warn you guys, before
you start copying everything

21
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,080
from the board,
starting last week

22
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,730
I've been taking pictures of
the board at the end of class.

23
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,960
So if you prefer to look and
listen or just take a few notes

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,700
rather than copy
everything else down,

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,033
I'll be taking pictures of
the board at the end of class

26
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:10,200
from now on and posting
them to the Stellar site.

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,302
So up to you how
you want to do it.

28
00:01:12,302 --> 00:01:14,010
We started off with
just three equations.

29
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,710
We conserve mass,
energy, and momentum.

30
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,320
Mass and energy-- let's see--

31
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,270
come from the same equation.

32
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:28,320
c squared plus T1 plus
M2 c squared plus T2

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:37,260
has to equal M3 c squared plus
T3 plus M4 c squared plus T4.

34
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,230
We started off making
one quick assumption,

35
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,260
that the nucleus 2, whatever
we're firing things at,

36
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,670
has no kinetic energy.

37
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,115
So we can just forget that.

38
00:01:47,115 --> 00:01:48,810
What we also said
is that we have

39
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,660
to conserve x and y momentum.

40
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,600
So if we say the x
momentum of particle 1

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,930
would be root 2 M1 T1
plus 0 for particle 2,

42
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,650
because if particle 2 is not
moving, it has no momentum.

43
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:12,090
Has to equal root 2
M3 T3 cosine theta,

44
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,480
because it's the x
component of the momentum,

45
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,740
plus root 2 M4 T4 cosine phi.

46
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,880
And the last equation
for y momentum--

47
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,940
we'll call this x momentum,
call that mass and energy,

48
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,360
call this y momentum--

49
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,050
was-- let's say there's no
y momentum at the beginning

50
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,350
of this equation.

51
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,550
So I'll just say 0 plus 0.

52
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,450
Equals the y component of
particle 3's momentum, root

53
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:52,230
2 M3 T3 sine theta, minus--

54
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,730
almost did that
wrong-- because it's

55
00:02:53,730 --> 00:03:02,800
going in the opposite direction,
root 2 M4 T4 sine phi.

56
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,140
We did something, and we
arrived at the Q equation.

57
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,805
I'm trying to make sure we
get to something new today.

58
00:03:11,805 --> 00:03:13,430
So the Q equation
went something like--

59
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,110
and I want to make sure that
I don't miswrite it at all.

60
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,320
So when we refer
to the Q equation,

61
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,700
we're referring to this highly
generalized equation relating

62
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,342
all of the quantities
that we see here.

63
00:03:31,342 --> 00:03:33,300
So I'm not going to go
through all of the steps

64
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,758
from last time,
because, again, you

65
00:03:34,758 --> 00:03:36,810
have a picture of the
board from last time.

66
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:47,550
But it went Q equals T1 times M1
over M4 minus 1 plus T3 times 1

67
00:03:47,550 --> 00:04:01,348
plus M3 over M4 minus 2 root
M1 M3 T1 T3 cosine theta.

68
00:04:01,348 --> 00:04:03,640
And last time we talked about
which of these quantities

69
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,230
are we likely to
know ahead of time

70
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,480
and which ones might
we want to find out.

71
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,460
Chances are we know all
of the masses involved

72
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,210
in these particles,
because, well, you guys have

73
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,790
been calculating that for the
last 2 and 1/2 weeks or so.

74
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,920
So those would be
known quantities.

75
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,360
We'd also know the Q value for
the reaction from conservation

76
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,160
of mass and energy up there.

77
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,310
And we'd probably be controlling
the energy of particle 1

78
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,060
as it comes in.

79
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,920
Either we know--
if it's a neutron,

80
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,397
we know what energy
it's born at.

81
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:32,980
Or if it's coming
from an accelerator,

82
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,040
we crank up the voltage on the
accelerator and control that.

83
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,010
And that leaves us
with just three quant--

84
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,080
two quantities that
we don't know--

85
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,800
the kinetic energy of
particle 3 and the angle

86
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,030
that it comes off at.

87
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,580
So this was the highly,
highly generalized form.

88
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,220
Recognize also that this is a
quadratic equation in root 3,

89
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,135
or root T3.

90
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:09,180
And we did something
else, and we

91
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:16,140
arrived at root T3 equals
s plus or minus root s

92
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:21,700
squared plus t, where s and t--

93
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,200
let's see.

94
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:33,980
I believe s is root M1 M3 T1
cosine theta over M3 plus M4.

95
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,510
And we'll make a
little bit more room.

96
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:40,270
t should be-- damn
it, got to look.

97
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:40,770
Let's see.

98
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:46,232
I believe it's minus M4 Q plus--

99
00:05:46,232 --> 00:05:50,078
oh, I'll just take a quick look.

100
00:05:50,078 --> 00:05:51,620
All right, I have
it open right here.

101
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,141
I don't want to give you a
wrong minus sign or something.

102
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,110
I did have a wrong minus sign.

103
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:58,950
Good thing I looked.

104
00:06:04,175 --> 00:06:12,160
1 times E1 over M3 M4.

105
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,870
And so we started
looking at, well,

106
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,960
what are the implications
of this solution right here?

107
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:25,350
For exothermic reactions,
where Q is greater than 0,

108
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,710
any energy E1 gets
this reaction to occur.

109
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,220
And all that that says, well,
it doesn't really say much.

110
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,195
All that it really
says is that E3--

111
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:40,140
I'm sorry-- T3-- and let me
make sure that I don't use any

112
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,420
sneaky E's in there--

113
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,770
plus T4 has to be greater
than the incoming energy T1.

114
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,840
That's the only real
implication here,

115
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,780
is that some of the mass
from particles 1 and 2

116
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,940
turned into some kinetic
energy in particles 3 and 4.

117
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,480
So that one's kind
of the simpler case.

118
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:06,120
For the endothermic case,
where Q is less than 0,

119
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,350
there's going to be some
threshold energy required

120
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:14,210
to overcome in order to
get this reaction to occur.

121
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,300
So where did we say?

122
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,550
So, first of all, where
would we go about deciding

123
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,575
what is the most favorable
set of conditions

124
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,200
that would allow one
of these reactions

125
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,448
to occur by manipulating
parameters in s and t?

126
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:29,490
What's the first one that
you'd start to look at?

127
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,960
Well, let's start by
picking the angle.

128
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,610
Let's say if there
was a-- if we had

129
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,590
what's called
forward scattering,

130
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:45,730
then this cosine
of theta equals 1.

131
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,850
And that probably gives
us the highest likelihood

132
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:52,002
of a reaction happening, or
the most energy gone into,

133
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:53,710
let's say, just moving
the center of mass

134
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,025
and not the particles going
off in different directions.

135
00:07:57,025 --> 00:07:57,525
Let's see.

136
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,010
Ah, so what it really
comes down to is

137
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,670
a balance in making sure
that this term right here,

138
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,020
well, it can't go negative.

139
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,440
If it goes negative, then
the solution is imaginary

140
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,630
and you don't have
anything going on.

141
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,430
So what this implies
is that s squared

142
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:23,070
plus t has to be greater or
equal than 0 in order for this

143
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,320
to occur.

144
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,500
Otherwise, you would
have, like I said,

145
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,847
a complex solution to an energy.

146
00:08:29,847 --> 00:08:31,430
And energy is not
going to be complex.

147
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,570
That means the
reaction won't occur.

148
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,760
So this is where we
got to last time.

149
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,260
Yes.

150
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,890
AUDIENCE: When you say s
squared plus t is greater than 0

151
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,169
or greater than or equal
to 0, it's endothermic,

152
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:45,390
wouldn't it also be
greater than or equal to 0

153
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,290
for an exothermic?

154
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,290
MICHAEL SHORT: It would.

155
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,870
But there's a
condition here that--

156
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,860
lets see.

157
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,710
In this case, for
exothermic, Q is greater

158
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,230
than 0 and that condition
is always satisfied.

159
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,030
For an endothermic
reaction, Q is negative.

160
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,310
So that's a good point.

161
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:06,210
So if endothermic,
then Q is less than 0,

162
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,250
and it's all about making
sure that that sum,

163
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,720
s squared plus t,
is not negative.

164
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,480
What that means is in
order to balance out

165
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,360
the fact that you've
got a negative Q here,

166
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,610
you have to increase T1 in order
to make that sum greater than

167
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,810
or equal to 0.

168
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,310
Yes.

169
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,660
AUDIENCE: So that
condition, s squared

170
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,300
plus t is greater
than or equal to 0,

171
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,200
is that basically a condition
for the endothermic reaction

172
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,770
to occur?

173
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,060
MICHAEL SHORT: That's correct.

174
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,910
If s squared plus t is
smaller than 0, which

175
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,660
is to say that this whole sum
right here doesn't help you

176
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,220
balance out the negative
Q, then the reaction

177
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,650
is not going to happen.

178
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,210
And something else might happen.

179
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,110
So let's say you were looking at
a case of inelastic scattering

180
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,050
where a neutron would
get absorbed by a nucleus

181
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,420
and be re-emitted at a
different energy level.

182
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,300
If the energy is too
small for that to occur,

183
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,220
then the neutron is not
going to get absorbed.

184
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,930
Instead it might bounce off
and undergo elastic scattering.

185
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,410
And as a quick
flash forward, I'll

186
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:07,590
show you a quick plot of elastic
and inelastic cross-sections

187
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,210
that kind of hammers this home.

188
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,550
You'll be looking at a
lot of these plots, that

189
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,030
are going to be
logarithmic in energy space

190
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:20,450
and probably logarithmic in
microscopic cross-section,

191
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,053
to bring back that
variable from before.

192
00:10:23,053 --> 00:10:24,470
If you remember,
the cross-section

193
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,640
is like the probability
that a certain reaction

194
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,860
is going to occur.

195
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,080
The larger the
cross-section, the higher

196
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,650
the reaction rate for a
given flux of particles.

197
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,300
And let's say we'll split
this into two things.

198
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,610
We'll call it sigma elastic
and sigma inelastic.

199
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,230
And we'll give them--

200
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,070
that will be-- oh,
we have colors.

201
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,200
Let's just use those.

202
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,970
Even better.

203
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,560
Where's my second color?

204
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,730
Under the paper.

205
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,410
Awesome.

206
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,920
So let's say the elastic
cross-section is in red,

207
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,540
and the inelastic
cross-section is in green.

208
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:03,140
And for white, we'll
plot sigma total.

209
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,240
Usually, one of these
cross-sections for any old

210
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,842
interaction--

211
00:11:05,842 --> 00:11:07,550
I'm not even being
specific on which one.

212
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,310
Let's just say neutrons
hitting something big--

213
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,050
would tend to look like this.

214
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,750
There will be some insanity
here, that we'll discuss,

215
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,033
and it might start to
increase a little bit

216
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:19,200
as it goes to high energies.

217
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,070
And this is definitely
not to scale.

218
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,340
Just for the purposes
of illustration.

219
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,830
The elastic cross-section
is going to look something

220
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:33,183
like exactly this.

221
00:11:33,183 --> 00:11:34,850
See how closely I can
draw on top of it.

222
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,300
So at low energies,
when a neutron

223
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,270
can't be absorbed and re-emitted
at a different energy,

224
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,690
the inelastic scattering
process can't happen.

225
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,220
Which is to say that the
incoming kinetic energy--

226
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,720
so this log of E right
here, better known

227
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,360
as T1 in the symbols up there--

228
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,562
it's not high enough to allow
inelastic scattering to occur.

229
00:12:00,562 --> 00:12:02,520
So if we want to graph
the inelastic scattering

230
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,290
cross-section, it
will typically look

231
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:11,570
like that, where once
you reach your threshold

232
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:16,390
energy, determined by
that condition there,

233
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,790
then the inelastic
scattering turns on

234
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,460
and it's actually
able to proceed.

235
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,960
So this is why we're getting
into these threshold reactions,

236
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,840
because it helps
you understand why

237
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,970
do some of the
cross-sections that we study

238
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,980
have the shapes that they do.

239
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,800
And this holds true
for pretty much

240
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,140
every inelastic
cross-section I've seen,

241
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,940
is they all--
almost all of them,

242
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,565
if you're starting
at the ground state,

243
00:12:39,565 --> 00:12:42,050
require some initial
energy input to get going.

244
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,930
Whereas elastic scattering
can happen at any energy.

245
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,570
So let's write that last
condition right here.

246
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:56,750
Elastic scattering,
which means things just

247
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:01,490
bounce off like billiard
balls, you have Q equals 0.

248
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,210
No energy changes
hands, so to speak.

249
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,190
You just get some
kinetic energy from 1

250
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:11,870
being imparted to nucleus 2,
but you don't turn any mass

251
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,590
into energy.

252
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,330
So any questions here
before we go into--

253
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:17,940
yes.

254
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,880
AUDIENCE: If theta isn't
0 for cosine theta,

255
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,922
how would you plug it in?

256
00:13:20,922 --> 00:13:24,433
If you don't know what the angle
is, that it's not [INAUDIBLE]??

257
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:25,850
MICHAEL SHORT: So
the question is,

258
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,400
if you don't know the angle,
what do you do about it, right?

259
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,140
If you don't-- so in
this case, we've said,

260
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,330
what is the bare minimum
threshold for this reaction

261
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,860
to occur, and the best way for
that to happen is for theta

262
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,040
to equal 0.

263
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,752
If theta is larger,
that will actually

264
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,210
mean that the reaction is not
allowed to proceed unless you

265
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,110
get to an even higher energy.

266
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,290
So this condition still holds.

267
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:53,140
But if cosine-- so let's say
if cosine theta is less than 1,

268
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:58,410
then the value of s goes down,
and that makes this condition

269
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,550
harder to satisfy.

270
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,140
So that's a good question.

271
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,350
What that actually means is that
for certain nuclear reactions

272
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,060
very close to the
threshold energy,

273
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,760
only certain angles are allowed.

274
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,510
I'm not going to get
into the nitty-gritty

275
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,677
of which angles are allowed.

276
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:13,940
I think it's--

277
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,070
I'll call it minutia for
the scope of this class,

278
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,840
but it is in the
Yip reading, which

279
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,960
I'll be posting pretty soon.

280
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,590
But suffice to say that the
only time you can-- let's say

281
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,050
if s squared plus t equals 0.

282
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,600
The only time that can
happen is when theta

283
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,700
equals 0 or cosine equals 1.

284
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,240
And that means that the nucleus
can only recoil in a very, very

285
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,130
narrow cone forward.

286
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,550
As that energy increases,
the allowable angles

287
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,018
start to increase further.

288
00:14:42,018 --> 00:14:43,310
Does that answer your question?

289
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:43,720
AUDIENCE: Well, yes.

290
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,095
So you're just
saying [INAUDIBLE]

291
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:48,500
0 is the minimum [INAUDIBLE].

292
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,310
MICHAEL SHORT: Or you'd say--
let's say if cosine equals 180.

293
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,510
Then-- I'm sorry.

294
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,680
If theta equals 180,
cosine would be negative 1.

295
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,330
And that would be, let's say,
the least favorable condition.

296
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,404
Yes.

297
00:15:00,404 --> 00:15:04,180
AUDIENCE: Why did you
put the sigma total

298
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,490
under sigma elastic?

299
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,920
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, I'm saying--
so sigma elastic plus--

300
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,260
sorry-- sigma inelastic
would, let's say,

301
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,728
give you the total
scattering cross-section.

302
00:15:14,728 --> 00:15:16,520
AUDIENCE: And then what
was the green line?

303
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,460
MICHAEL SHORT: The green line--
oh, it is a little hard to see.

304
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,620
The green line is the
inelastic cross-section.

305
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,120
Yes.

306
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,280
I can imagine from
back there the green

307
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,620
and the white might look
a little similar, yes.

308
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,280
OK, cool.

309
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,780
Yes.

310
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,820
Like one of these,
they give they give me

311
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,130
an almost black one.

312
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,110
That's about as
invisible as it gets.

313
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,020
So make sure to
use visible colors.

314
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:39,950
OK.

315
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:44,782
So now let's take the case of
elastic neutron scattering.

316
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,090
And can anyone tell me how
can we simplify the general Q

317
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,610
equation for the
case of neutrons

318
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,910
hitting some random nucleus?

319
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,160
What can we start plugging
in for some of those values

320
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,952
to make it simpler?

321
00:16:08,073 --> 00:16:08,990
What about the masses?

322
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:13,505
What's M1 in atomic mass units?

323
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:14,005
AUDIENCE: 1.

324
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:17,345
MICHAEL SHORT: M1 is just 1 to
a pretty good approximation.

325
00:16:17,345 --> 00:16:22,940
It's actually 1.0087, which
we're going to say is 1.

326
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,770
And what about M3?

327
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,640
AUDIENCE: 1.

328
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,010
MICHAEL SHORT: Is
also-- yes, also 1.

329
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,660
If this is elastic
neutron scattering,

330
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,000
the same neutron
goes in and goes out.

331
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,410
So M1 and M3 are the same thing.

332
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:41,670
What about M2 and M4?

333
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,320
Have we specified
what this nucleus is?

334
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,880
So what mass would we give it
if it's a general nucleus with N

335
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,160
neutrons and Z protons?

336
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:51,660
AUDIENCE: A.

337
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,200
MICHAEL SHORT: A, sure.

338
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,630
So A, that's again A
for the mass number.

339
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,790
Cool.

340
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,490
So with those in mind,
and then the last thing is

341
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,980
we only have T1 and T3.

342
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,369
Just for clarity, let's call
T1 Tin, like the neutron energy

343
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:11,599
going in.

344
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,450
And T3, we'll call Tout.

345
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:20,960
So let's rewrite the
Q equation, the Q-eq,

346
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,819
with these symbols in there.

347
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,829
And the last thing
to note, what's

348
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:28,650
Q for elastic scattering?

349
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,220
0, yes.

350
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,750
Because no mass is turned
into energy or vice versa.

351
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:37,180
So to rewrite the whole
Q equation, we'll get 0

352
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:45,520
equals Tin times M1 over
M4, which is just 1 over A,

353
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:55,600
minus 1 plus Tout times
1 plus M3 over M4.

354
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:04,670
M3 is also 1, M4 is also
A. And minus 2 root M1 M3.

355
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,160
They're both 1.

356
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:13,690
Tin Tout cosine theta.

357
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,570
So this looks a
whole lot simpler.

358
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,480
I'm going to do one quick
thing right here and take

359
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,440
the minus sign that's hiding
in here outside this equation.

360
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,417
It's going to make the
form a lot simpler.

361
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:28,500
So I'm just multiplying
the inside and the outside

362
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,375
of this term by negative
1, but hopefully you

363
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,920
can see that it's
the same thing.

364
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,250
It will just make the form
a lot nicer in the end.

365
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,850
And so now we want
to start asking,

366
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:39,120
what is the maximum
and minimum energy

367
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,895
that the neutron can lose?

368
00:18:41,895 --> 00:18:43,270
So let's start
with the easy one.

369
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,118
What is the minimum
amount of energy

370
00:18:45,118 --> 00:18:46,285
that the neutron could lose?

371
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,010
Anyone?

372
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,420
I hear some whispers.

373
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,260
AUDIENCE: 0.

374
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,290
MICHAEL SHORT: 0.

375
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,490
And if the neutron comes in--

376
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:02,350
if theta equals
0, then you end up

377
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:08,230
with actually Tin
will equal Tout.

378
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:13,720
And, that way, let's say
delta T1 or delta T neutron

379
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,920
could equal 0.

380
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,420
So a neutron can lose at
least none of its energy

381
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,810
in an elastic collision.

382
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,310
Hopefully that makes
intuitive sense

383
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,530
because we would
call that a miss.

384
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,950
Now let's take the other case.

385
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,680
At what angle would
you think the neutron

386
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:36,590
would transfer as much energy as
possible to the recoil nucleus?

387
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,360
So if we have a big
nucleus of mass A

388
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:46,230
and we have a little neutron
firing at it, at which angle

389
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,850
does it transfer
the most energy?

390
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:52,230
Yes.

391
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,930
AUDIENCE: Pi?

392
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:53,812
If it's like--

393
00:19:53,812 --> 00:19:54,770
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

394
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

395
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,960
MICHAEL SHORT: At theta
equals pi, which means this--

396
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,720
we call this backscattering.

397
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,530
So, yes, good one.

398
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,030
I'll correct your
statement, though.

399
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,870
You said if the
neutron just stopped

400
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,550
and the nucleus moved forward.

401
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,300
Does not happen in every case.

402
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,640
For example, if you were to--
and I'd say don't try this

403
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,630
at home, kids--

404
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:23,800
put on a nice helmet and
run charging at a truck,

405
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,750
can you actually just stop cold?

406
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,180
And we're not assuming any
bones breaking or anything.

407
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,080
Chances are you'd
bounce right back off.

408
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,580
Yes.

409
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,040
That's the analogy I like to
give for what happens when

410
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,930
a neutron scatters off uranium.

411
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,160
It's like running at a
truck with a helmet on.

412
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,940
It will just bounce back.

413
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,670
So in the case of
theta equals pi--

414
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:47,760
so we're going to substitute
in theta equals pi.

415
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,926
Therefore, cosine theta
equals negative 1,

416
00:20:51,926 --> 00:20:54,880
and we have an even
easier equation.

417
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:03,610
0 equals, let's just say,
Tout times 1 plus 1 over A.

418
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,770
I'm going to arrange
these terms in order

419
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:10,120
of their exponent for Tout
since that's our variable again.

420
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:15,460
And if this stuff is negative
1, then the 2 minus signs

421
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,890
cancel conveniently.

422
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:25,550
And we have plus
2 root Tin Tout.

423
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,050
Let's see.

424
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,270
That's it.

425
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:38,530
And we have minus Tin
times 1 over 1 minus A.

426
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,960
Ideally, we'd like to try
to simplify this as much

427
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,580
as possible.

428
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,213
So let's combine.

429
00:21:44,213 --> 00:21:45,880
Let's try to get
everything in some sort

430
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,070
of a common denominator,
because that

431
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,720
would make things a lot easier.

432
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,830
If we multiply each of
these 1's by A over A--

433
00:21:53,830 --> 00:22:03,970
so let's put that as a step,
because we can totally do

434
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,770
that--

435
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:12,220
we get 0 over Tout
times A over A plus 1

436
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:24,250
over A plus 2 root Tin
Tout minus Tin times A

437
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,270
over A minus 1 over A.

438
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,770
At this point, we can--

439
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,740
well, everything's in
common terms, right?

440
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,480
We can just extend that fraction
sign and put the sign in here.

441
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,930
Extend the fraction sign,
put the sign in here.

442
00:22:43,882 --> 00:22:49,290
And we'll just say that's
A. We'll say that's A.

443
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:52,110
Last step that we'll do
is try and isolate Tout

444
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,840
so at least one of our quadratic
factors is going to be simple,

445
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,690
like 1.

446
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:04,570
So next step,
divide by A plus 1.

447
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:10,810
And then we get 0 equals
just Tout plus 2 over A plus

448
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:26,330
one root Tin Tout minus Tin
times A minus 1 over A plus 1.

449
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:29,150
Now we've got a simple-looking
quadratic equation,

450
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,490
even though it's quadratic
in the square root of Tout.

451
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:31,990
Yes.

452
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:35,368

the A from the denominator?

00:23:35,368 --> 00:23:36,410

00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:37,827
AUDIENCE: Could
it be Tout over A?

00:23:42,062 --> 00:23:43,270
MICHAEL SHORT: What did I do?

00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,320
Did I miss an A

two equations.

from back here?

AUDIENCE: No, no, no.

00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,880
It's probably the
step you just did.

461
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,260
MICHAEL SHORT: Just these steps.

462
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,480
AUDIENCE: So you
divide by A plus 1.

463
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,980
MICHAEL SHORT: Ah, I see.

464
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,720
AUDIENCE: Should
it be Tout over A?

465

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:23:57,565 --> 00:23:58,940
MICHAEL SHORT:
Yes, you're right.

467
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,470
So I want to make
sure I didn't skip

468
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,180
a step in dividing
an A. Let me just

469
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,172
check something real quick.

470
00:24:04,172 --> 00:24:05,630
AUDIENCE: There
should've been an A

471
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,977
in the minus 2 square root.

00:24:08,977 --> 00:24:10,310
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, you're right.

473
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:14,300
If we go back to
our Q equation--

474
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,190
let's see.

475
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,130
There's an M4
missing, isn't there?

476
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,296
That's it.

477
00:24:21,296 --> 00:24:22,220
Hah.

478
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:26,150
See, this is what happens when
you don't look at your notes.

479
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,550
I'll go back and correct
those, because then there

480
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:35,240
should have been an over A.
There should have been an over

481
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,300
A. There should
have been an over A.

482
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,710
Thank you for pointing that out.

483
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:43,100
And there should
have been another--

484
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:47,190
oh, in this case we can
just cancel all of the A's.

485
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,750
I knew it came out
nice and clean.

486
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,150
OK, cool.

487
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:56,360
So at this point, this
is a quadratic in root

488
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:03,350
Tout, where we have--

489
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:07,590
what are our a, b, and c terms
for this quadratic formula?

490
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,130
So what's a first of all if
it's quadratic in root Tout?

491

AUDIENCE: 1?

492
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,482
MICHAEL SHORT: Just 1.

493
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:18,440
That was part of the goal
of this manipulation,

494
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,440
is to make at least one of
these things pretty simple.

495
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,010
What's b?

496
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:29,048
AUDIENCE: 2 over A plus
1 times radical Tin?

497
00:25:29,048 --> 00:25:29,840
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

498
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,610
2 root Tin over A plus 1.

499
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,590
And c is just that
whole term right there.

500
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,300
I'll do this up here.

501
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,710
So then we can say root
Tout equals negative

502
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:55,360
b plus or minus the
square root of b squared.

503
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,110
So that's 4 Tin over
A plus 1 squared.

504
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:08,140
Minus 4 times a times c,
so just minus 4 times c.

505
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:18,820
So minus 4 times negative
Tin A minus 1 over A plus 1.

506
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,420
So let's see what cancels.

507
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:24,730
So, first of all, those
minus signs cancel.

508
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,877
And everything has--
oh, and over 2a.

509
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:28,960
Don't want to forget that.

510
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,620
Over 2a, which is just 2.

511
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:36,340
First thing we note is that
everything here has a 2 in it,

512
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,850
either directly as a 2 or
hiding as a square root of 4.

513
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,930
So we can cancel all of those.

514
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:46,736
4, 4, 4, 4.

515
00:26:46,736 --> 00:26:50,565
Let me make sure that minus
sign is nice and visible.

516
00:26:50,565 --> 00:26:52,190
What else is common
to everything here?

517
00:27:00,748 --> 00:27:01,790
Well, I'll tell you what.

518
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:04,160
I'll write it all out
simpler without all

519
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,200
the crossed-out stuff.

520
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:12,620
Minus root Tin over A
plus 1 plus or minus

521
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:26,380
root Tin over A plus 1 squared
plus Tin times A minus 1

522
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,330
over A plus 1.

523
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,220
So with that written
a little simpler,

524
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,188
what's also common and can be
factored out of everything?

525
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,870
AUDIENCE: Square root of Ti?

526
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,037
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

527
00:27:39,037 --> 00:27:40,240
Square root of Tin.

528
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,232
Because there's a root Tin
here, and then you can--

529
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,190
everything's got a Tin
inside the square roots.

530
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,590
You can pull that out.

531
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:50,770
So we have a direct relation
between root Tout and root Tin.

532
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:58,660
Minus 1 over A plus
1 plus or minus

533
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:10,180
root 1 over A plus 1 squared
plus A minus 1 over A plus 1.

534
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,568
What do we do here to
simplify all the junk

535
00:28:12,568 --> 00:28:13,360
in the square root?

536
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:25,273
AUDIENCE: Multiply the right
side by A plus 1 over A plus 1.

537
00:28:25,273 --> 00:28:26,440
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

538
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,700
You can always multiply by
something, better known as 1.

539
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,660
And that gets
everything here-- just

540
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,380
like there was a 2 or a root
4 everywhere in the equation,

541
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,870
or there was a root
Tin and a root Tin

542
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,490
everywhere else in
the equation, we'll

543
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:42,430
do the same thing to get
the A plus 1 out of there.

544
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:48,078
So we'll multiply this by
A plus 1 over A plus 1.

545
00:28:48,078 --> 00:28:49,120
I'll stick it over there.

546
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,190
OK.

547
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:58,660
And we get root Tout equals--

548
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:03,400
now everything has an A
plus 1, so let's bring all

549
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,875
of those outside the fraction.

550
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:18,740
Root Tin over A plus
1 times negative 1

551
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:27,070
plus or minus the square root
of 1 plus A minus 1, A plus 1.

552
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:29,330
Starting to get a lot simpler.

553
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:32,250
Let's see how much-- if I run
out of space for this one.

554
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:36,020
So this stuff right
here is just A squared

555
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:40,180
minus A plus A minus 1.

556
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:44,390
The minus A and the
plus A cancel out.

557
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,580
And then the plus 1 and
the minus 1 cancel out.

558
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,480
And all that's inside the
square root is A squared.

559
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,600
So the only hopefully
nonlinear board technique,

560
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,470
I'm going to move to the left.

561
00:29:55,470 --> 00:30:04,010
And we end up with root Tout
equals root Tin over A plus 1.

562
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:08,380
And all that's left
there is A minus 1

563
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,390
if we take the positive root.

564
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,840
Almost done.

565
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,318
Just square both sides.

566
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:20,110
And we should arrive
at a result that might

567
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,480
look familiar to some of you.

568
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:32,790
Tout equals Tin times A minus
1 over A plus 1 squared.

569
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,850
And we've gotten to
the point now where

570
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:38,780
we can determine how much energy
the neutron can possibly lose

571
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,610
or the recoil
nucleus can possibly

572
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:43,680
gain in an elastic collision.

573
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,650
It's this factor right here.

574
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:48,620
I'll use the red since
it's more visible.

575
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:54,860
This is usually referred to
in nuclear textbooks as alpha.

576
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,860
It's sort of the maximum amount
of energy a neutron can lose

577
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,450
or a recoil nucleus can gain.

578
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:07,380
So what we've arrived at is
a pretty important result,

579
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:13,730
that, let's say, the energy,
the kinetic energy of a neutron,

580
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:20,600
has to be between its initial
kinetic energy and alpha times

581
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,610
its initial kinetic energy.

582
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,890
This right here is one
of the ways in which you

583
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,470
choose a moderator
or a slowing down

584
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:30,420
medium for neutrons in reactors.

585
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,880
So it's this alpha
factor right here

586
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,230
that really distinguishes
what we call a thermal--

587
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,240
or what is it?

588
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,310
Like a light water reactor
or a thermal spectrum

589
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:41,610
reactor from a fast
spectrum reactor.

590
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:45,020
Let's look at a couple of
limiting cases to see why.

591
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,920
Let's see.

592
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,600
Anyone mind if I
hide this board here?

593
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,290
Or you have a question?

594
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:48,873
AUDIENCE: Yes.

595
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:53,030
Can you explain why you ended
up dropping the negative case?

596
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,080
MICHAEL SHORT: Let's see.

597
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,820
If we took the negative case,
we'd end up with minus 1

598
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:05,010
minus A. You just have
an A plus 1 on the top.

599
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:05,510
Yes.

600
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,060
So in that case, you just have--

601
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,790
let's see.

602
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,040
You just have root Tin, right?

603
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:13,430
Let me see.

604
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,472
AUDIENCE: Negative
root Tin actually.

605
00:32:15,472 --> 00:32:16,430
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, yes.

606
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,650
So that wouldn't make
very much sense, right?

607
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,340
Yes.

608
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,522
So in that case, well, you don't
want to have a negative energy.

609
00:32:22,522 --> 00:32:24,230
So that case doesn't
make physical sense.

610
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:26,210
Thanks for making sure
we explained that.

611
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,520
And did I see another question?

612
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,020
Yes.

613
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,603
AUDIENCE: Yes.

614
00:32:28,603 --> 00:32:30,320
What happened to
the coefficients

615
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,400
you had before Tin?

616
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,125
You had 4.

617
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:34,900
You needed 4 or 2,
but [INAUDIBLE]..

618
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,650
MICHAEL SHORT: Ah.

619
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:36,150
OK.

620
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:39,500
So what I did is I took the
square root of 4 out of every

621
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,950
term inside the square root
and said, OK, they're all 2's.

622
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,930
Just like in the next
step, I said, all right,

623
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,600
there's all of these
A plus 1's, including

624
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,360
all of these A plus 1's
squares inside the square root,

625
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,530
and took that out.

626
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,760
Or I think even over here.

627
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,610
Yes, so the whole thing here
has been combine and destroy.

628
00:32:58,197 --> 00:33:00,780
Any other questions on what we
did here before I go on to some

629
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,238
of the implications
of what we got?

630
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,432
Cool.

631
00:33:05,432 --> 00:33:07,015
Let's look at a
couple limiting cases.

632
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,390
I'll rewrite that inequality
right there because that's

633
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,640
the important one of the day.

634
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,220
So what is alpha for
typical materials?

635
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:28,940
Let's say for hydrogen.
Alpha equals--

636
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:34,160
well, it's always A minus
1 over A plus 1 squared.

637
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,990
And for hydrogen, A
equals equals 1, equals 1.

638
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,730
And then we have 1 minus
1 in the numerator.

639
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,860
Alpha equals 0.

640
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,620
What this means is that
for the case of hydrogen,

641
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:51,694
you can lose all of the neutron
energy in a single collision.

642
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,260
That doesn't mean that you lose
all energy in every collision

643
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,215
with a hydrogen atom
if you're a neutron,

644
00:34:01,215 --> 00:34:02,590
but it means that
you can lose up

645
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:05,710
to all of your energy
in one single collision.

646
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,800
And this is what makes
hydrogen such a good moderator

647
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,770
or a slower down of neutrons,
is when it undergoes

648
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:15,820
elastic scattering, especially
at energies below an MeV or so,

649
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,790
which is where most of the
neutrons in the reactor are,

650
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,050
it just bounces around.

651
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:22,030
And the more it hits
hydrogens, the more

652
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:25,222
it imparts energy to those
hydrogens and slows down.

653
00:34:25,222 --> 00:34:26,889
Why do we want to
slow the neutrons down

654
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:28,460
in the first place?

655
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,219
Well, that has to do with
another cross-section,

656
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:33,219
that I'm going to draw
if I can find some chalk.

657
00:34:36,531 --> 00:34:37,989
Like I think I've
mentioned before,

658
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:42,080
every nuclear reaction
has its own cross-section.

659
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,219
And this time I'm going to
introduce a new one called

660
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:50,840
sigma fission, the probability,
if a nucleus absorbs

661
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,179
a neutron, that it undergoes
fission and creates

662
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:57,540
more neutrons and like
200 MeV of recoil energy.

663
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,760
So in this case, I'll
draw it for U235,

664
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,250
since this is the one I pretty
much remember from memory.

665
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:08,240
And it looks
something like that.

666
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,650
So what you want is for the
neutrons to be at low energies.

667
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:17,240
So this would be around the
thermal energy, better known

668
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,180
as about 0.025 eV.

669
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,490
Your goal is that the
more neutrons that you

670
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:25,020
have in this energy region--

671
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,890
oh, that chalk
erases other chalk.

672
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:31,010
The more neutrons you have in
that energy region, the higher

673
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,720
probability you have a fission.

674
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,270
So this is the basis
behind thermal reactors,

675
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:39,200
is the neutrons all start here.

676
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,740
They're born at
around 1 to 10 MeV.

677
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:48,100
They don't undergo fission
very well at 1 to 10 MeV.

678
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,590
So your goal as a
thermal reactor designer

679
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,840
is to slow them down as
efficiently as possible.

680
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,130
What's the most efficient
way to slow down neutrons?

681
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:59,680
Cram the reactor
full of hydrogen.

682
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,810
What's the cheapest and most
hydrogenous substance we know?

683
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,250
Water.

684
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:10,000
This is why water makes such
a good reactor moderator.

685
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,020
It's pretty cool.

686
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,770
There's also lots of other
reasons that we use water.

687
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:16,650
It's everywhere, which is
another way of saying cheap.

688
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,330
It's pretty chemically inert.

689
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,070
There are corrosion
problems in reactors,

690
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,710
but it doesn't just
spontaneously combust

691
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:26,880
when you see air, like sodium
does, another reactor coolant.

692
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,490
It takes a lot of
energy to heat it up.

693
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:34,242
So it's specific heat
capacity, the CP of water,

694
00:36:34,242 --> 00:36:34,950
if you remember--

695
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:42,210
I think it's-- was it
4.184 joules per gram?

696
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,645
That's a point.

697
00:36:44,645 --> 00:36:47,100
One of the highest
substances that we know of.

698
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,800
So you can put a lot
of that recoil energy

699
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,350
or a lot of heat
energy into this water

700
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,000
without raising its
temperature as much

701
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,740
as a comparative substance.

702
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,137
Metals can have heat capacity's
like three or four times lower.

703
00:36:59,137 --> 00:37:01,470
So you wouldn't necessarily
want to use a metal coolant.

704
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,180
Or would you?

705
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,700
In what cases would you
want to use a metal coolant

706
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,630
for a reactor?

707
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:10,140
Has anyone ever heard of
liquid metal reactors before?

708
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:10,900
Just a couple.

709
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,400
Good.

710
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,350
I get to be the first
one to tell you.

711
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:16,980
I did my whole PhD on alloys
for the liquid lead reactor.

712
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:23,230
So let's take a look at lead,
which has an A of about--

713
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:26,050
let's call it 200.

714
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,390
I think there's some
isotopes, like 203 or so.

715
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:31,390
There's probably an
isotope called lead 200.

716
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,790
What would alpha be for lead?

717
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,220
Well, let's just
plug in the numbers.

718
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,842
A minus 1 is 199.

719
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:44,740
A plus 1 is 201.

720
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,520
Square that.

721
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:51,080
Almost 1.

722
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,580
Almost.

723
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,910
This means that when neutrons
hit something like lead,

724
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,040
basically don't slow down.

725
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:04,240
They can lose at least
none and at most almost

726
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,032
none of their energy.

727
00:38:06,032 --> 00:38:07,490
And this is the
basis behind what's

728
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:10,820
called fast reactors if you
want to use a coolant that

729
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,190
keeps the neutrons very fast.

730
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,918
Because for uranium 238,
there's what's called a--

731
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,960
well, what you do is you
want to capture neutrons

732
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,670
with uranium 238, make plutonium
239, and then breed that.

733
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:29,493
Or uranium 238 has got its
fast fission cross-section.

734
00:38:29,493 --> 00:38:31,910
I don't think I want to get
into bringing it on the screen

735
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,590
today since we're
almost five of five of.

736
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:36,590
What I will say is there's
lots of other reactor

737
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,950
coolants besides water.

738
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,950
And it sounds to me like
almost no one had heard

739
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,450
of a liquid metal reactor.

740
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,370
Why would you want
to use a liquid metal

741
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:48,760
as a coolant besides keeping
the neutrons at high energy?

742
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,690
Anyone have any ideas?

743
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,050
What sort of properties do
you want out of a coolant?

744
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:59,790
Not even for a reactor
but for anything.

745
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:00,790
AUDIENCE: Heat transfer.

746
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,470
MICHAEL SHORT:
Good heat transfer.

747
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:05,110
Metals are extremely
thermally conductive.

748
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,750
So if you want to get the
heat out of the fuel rods

749
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,850
and into the coolant and
then out to make steam

750
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,790
for a turbine, liquid metals
are a pretty awesome coolant

751
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:16,540
to use because they conduct
heat extremely well.

752
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,080
What else?

753
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,740
Let's try and think now.

754
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,360
If you were a reactor
designer, you don't just

755
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,130
have to make the reactor
work but you want

756
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,450
to make it avoid accidents.

757
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:29,710
What sort of thermodynamic
properties about metals

758
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,738
could prevent accidents
from happening?

759
00:39:31,738 --> 00:39:32,828
AUDIENCE: They solidify.

760
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:33,620
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

761
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,740
So there's one problem.

762
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,170
They could solidify.

763
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:38,810
So coolants that have
been chosen for reactors

764
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,660
have been things like
sodium, which melts just

765
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,840
below 100 Celsius, liquid
lead-bismuth, which

766
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,550
melts at 123 Celsius.

767
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,180
And I know because I've
it in a frying pan before.

768
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,590
So I did four years of research
on liquid lead-bismuth,

769
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,110
and if there's anyone that's
gotten enough exposure to that,

770
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:54,800
it's me.

771
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,750
It does not seem to
have affected my brain

772
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,780
too much because I only
made like two major mistakes

773
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,580
on today's board.

774
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,480
Good enough.

775
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:03,980
Yes.

776
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:07,370
So we've got hundreds of pounds
of lead-bismuth sitting around.

777
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,990
It's pretty inert stuff.

778
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:13,500
It's really dense, so it
can store a lot of heat.

779
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,030
The other thing is
the boiling point.

780
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,280
Anyone know what
temperature metals boil at?

781
00:40:21,022 --> 00:40:22,850
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

782
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:25,130
MICHAEL SHORT:
Extremely high, yes.

783
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:31,250
Sodium boils at approximately
exactly 893 degrees Celsius.

784
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:36,080
Liquid lead-bismuth boils at
approximately exactly 1,670

785
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,130
Celsius.

786
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,110
You'll actually melt the
steel that the reactor

787
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:41,780
is made of before you
boil off your coolant.

788
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,370
And if you boil
your coolant, you

789
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:44,870
have no way of
cooling the reactor,

790
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,760
and that's something
you want to avoid.

791
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,510
Water boils at
approximately 325--

792
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:56,750
let's say 288 to 340 Celsius
depending on the pressure

793
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,310
that's used in the reactors.

794
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:00,470
And that does get reached
sometimes, especially

795
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,940
in accident conditions.

796
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:05,450
So if you want to make something
relatively Fukushima-proof,

797
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,490
then you don't want
the coolant to boil.

798
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:11,950
So use a liquid metal, which
introduces other problems.

799
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:14,040
It also introduces
some other problems.

800
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,190
I'm going to flash forward a bit
to neutrons and reactor design.

801
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:20,757
Because it does take time for
this scattering to happen.

802
00:41:20,757 --> 00:41:22,590
These collisions, they
happen pretty quickly

803
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:25,270
but they do take a
finite amount of time.

804
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:26,820
And in the meantime,
you can have

805
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,100
what's called
feedback coefficients,

806
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,130
natural bits of physics that
help your reactor stay stable

807
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:35,040
or they don't, depending
on whether it's called

808
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,950
negative or positive feedback.

809
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:42,540
So we can have either
negative or positive feedback.

810
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,750
I'll give you one simple
example that I'll just

811
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:52,180
introduce conceptually,
and we'll actually

812
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,890
explain it a little
mathematically later

813
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:55,010
in the course.

814
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,400
Let's talk about
coolant density.

815
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,650
If you were to heat
up your reactor

816
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,923
and the coolant were
to get less dense,

817
00:42:02,923 --> 00:42:04,840
what do you think would
happen to the reaction

818
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:09,040
rate of, well, anything--
scattering, fission,

819
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,408
absorption?

820
00:42:10,408 --> 00:42:11,650
AUDIENCE: Go down.

821
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:12,430
MICHAEL SHORT: It
should go down.

822
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,472
Why do you think that is?

823
00:42:13,472 --> 00:42:15,852
AUDIENCE: Because there's
not as many particles that's

824
00:42:15,852 --> 00:42:17,732
close together, so [INAUDIBLE].

825
00:42:17,732 --> 00:42:18,690
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

826
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:19,570
Yes.

827
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,120
To reintroduce a bit of the
cross-section stuff I mentioned

828
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,270
last time, the
microscopic cross-section

829
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:27,760
is the probability that,
let's say, one nucleus

830
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,140
hits one other nucleus.

831
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,920
If you then multiply
by the number density

832
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,290
or how many of
them are there, you

833
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:38,260
end up with the
macroscopic cross-section.

834
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:43,330
So I'll label this as
micro, label this as macro.

835
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:46,560
And then the macroscopic
cross-section

836
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:52,930
times your neutron flux
gives you your reaction rate.

837
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:56,110
So if you want to get less
moderating happening, or less

838
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,570
fission, or less
absorption, the simplest way

839
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:01,270
is-- well, that's a
property of the material.

840
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:03,310
That's whatever your
reactor is doing.

841
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:04,960
You can decrease
the number density

842
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,630
by heating things up and
decreasing the density.

843
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,600
So this is one of those cases
where you can use the reactor

844
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,780
to quickly respond with physics
before you could respond

845
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,280
with human intervention.

846
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,590
If you want, let's
say, a extra power

847
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:21,380
transient or a sudden
increase in heat

848
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:24,200
to slow down the nuclear
reaction and not speed it up,

849
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,870
you'd pick a moderator
that behaves in this way.

850
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:30,410
So in this case, water
would get less dense,

851
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:34,400
it would moderate less
well, and put fewer neutrons

852
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,600
in the high-probability
fission region.

853
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,130
Then let's think
about what happens

854
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:42,460
if you're depending on
your neutrons to stay fast

855
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,840
or at high energy.

856
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,240
Let's say you were to
have a really bad day

857
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,840
and boil your liquid sodium.

858
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,150
All of a sudden, what
little moderating power

859
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:55,350
exists in that sodium
disappears or gets even lower,

860
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:58,380
and that would cause your
reactor power to increase.

861
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,530
So one of the dangers of
fast spectrum reactors

862
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,740
is positive-- what's called
positive void coefficient.

863
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:08,310
Or if you make a bubble
of gaseous sodium,

864
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:10,830
your power increases
rather than decreases.

865
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:12,120
That would increase the heat.

866
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,620
That would cause
the power to go up.

867
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,828
That would increase the heat.

868
00:44:14,828 --> 00:44:16,410
That would cause
the power to go up.

869
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,660
Luckily, there are many,
many other negative feedback

870
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,610
mechanisms that
could be built in

871
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:23,700
to make sure the overall
feedback coefficients are still

872
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,540
negative.

873
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,240
This also lets us understand
a little bit about what

874
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,400
went wrong at Chernobyl.

875
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,660
And I'll give you a
1-minute flashforward.

876
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:36,140
Because the control
rods that were made of--

877
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:36,860
let's see.

878
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:40,280
I don't remember what the
composition of the control rods

879
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,920
is, but they were
neutron absorbers.

880
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,290
The control rods in
Chernobyl looked something

881
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:50,490
like this, where there
was the absorber here.

882
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:54,730
And this was-- they
were graphite tipped.

883
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:58,230
And as you lower that graphite
down into the reactor,

884
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:00,560
you're all of a sudden
introducing something.

885
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,930
Well, that's an OK moderator.

886
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:05,730
For carbon, let's
say A equals 12.

887
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:12,950
So our alpha will be A
minus 1 over A plus 1.

888
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:14,870
I'm not going to write
almost equal to 1

889
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:17,470
because that isn't
quite almost equal to 1.

890
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:18,720
What does this actually equal?

891
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,220
Let's see.

892
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:24,610
Let's just say
definitely less than 1.

893
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:27,040
There is some moderating
power to graphite.

894
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,350
It's also a very bad absorber.

895
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:32,020
And what this meant, that
as you lowered those control

896
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,210
rods into the reactor,
you suddenly introduced

897
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:37,300
a little more moderation when
things were already going bad,

898
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:40,263
and that caused the power
level to increase further.

899
00:45:40,263 --> 00:45:41,680
There were other
problems, like it

900
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,710
was designed so that if you
boiled some of the coolant,

901
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:46,623
you would have
positive feedback.

902
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,790
And that is the sort of
1-minute synopsis as to what

903
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:50,470
all went haywire at Chernobyl.

904
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:53,350
But we'll be doing a second
by second or, in some cases,

905
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,660
millisecond by
millisecond play of what

906
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:57,662
went wrong with Chernobyl.

907
00:45:57,662 --> 00:45:59,620
And we could probably do
the same for Fukushima

908
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:02,710
now, now that we understand what
happened, based on the physics

909
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:05,740
you'll be learning
in this course.

910
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:08,070
And this is actually a
perfect stopping point,

911
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:09,990
because next up we're
going to be looking

912
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:12,810
at the different processes
of radioactive decay,

913
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:14,910
many of which are a
simplification of this Q

914
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:17,190
equation, and I
think some of which

915
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,660
are probably
familiar to you guys,

916
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:22,680
because radiation decay is
part of the normal lexicon,

917
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,060
especially nowadays.

918
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,380
So since it's five of
five of, do you guys

919
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:28,380
have any questions on
what we've covered so far?

920
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,140
Yes.

921
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:34,740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] if you
have water as your coolant

922
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,912
and it gets too
hot, [INAUDIBLE]..

923
00:46:39,768 --> 00:46:40,560
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

924
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:40,800
AUDIENCE: Right.

925
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,114
And that will decrease
the reaction rate.

926
00:46:42,114 --> 00:46:42,990
MICHAEL SHORT: Um-hm.

927
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:47,690
AUDIENCE: And that's how
like the [INAUDIBLE]..

928
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:49,005
MICHAEL SHORT: It's actually--

929
00:46:49,005 --> 00:46:50,380
are you asking
about it the water

930
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:51,760
feedback is part of the backup?

931
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,160
That's your primary
line of defense.

932
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,780
Your backup is
human intervention,

933
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,280
because, compared
to physics, humans

934
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,340
are really, really slow,
like many orders of magnitude

935
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,360
slower.

936
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,540
It takes microseconds for
things to thermally expand.

937
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:07,870
It definitely takes more than
seconds for a human to respond.

938
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:10,493
Anyone ever done those tests
where you have a light blinking

939
00:47:10,493 --> 00:47:12,910
and you have to hit a button
the second you see the light?

940
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:16,970
What's the fastest any of
you guys have ever responded?

941
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:18,420
Anyone remember?

942
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,646
Anyone beat a second?

943
00:47:20,646 --> 00:47:21,545
AUDIENCE: Maybe.

944
00:47:21,545 --> 00:47:22,420
MICHAEL SHORT: Maybe.

945
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,294
A tenth of a second?

946
00:47:24,294 --> 00:47:28,590
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

947
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:31,202
MICHAEL SHORT: And there all
you have to do is hit a button.

948
00:47:31,202 --> 00:47:32,910
All you have to do is
hit the only button

949
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:34,925
when you see the only light.

950
00:47:34,925 --> 00:47:36,300
What if you're
piloting something

951
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,310
that's about as complicated
as the space shuttle

952
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:40,500
but more likely to explode?

953
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,920
What do you think your
reaction time will be?

954
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:44,820
Probably long.

955
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,330
You'll probably have
to pull out the manual.

956
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:51,690
And probably you'll have
to RTFM for a little while.

957
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:54,510
And maybe you'll find out what
you have to do and maybe you

958
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:55,410
won't.

959
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:57,210
So it's actually
operator error that

960
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:00,660
has caused most of the near
misses or actual misses

961
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:01,560
in nuclear reactors.

962
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,710
The physics, except for
the Russian RBMK design

963
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:07,140
that was for
Chernobyl, usually it's

964
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,150
human error that's the
downfall of these things.

965
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:12,130
So by understanding
the physics here,

966
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:15,130
we can rely on it
to keep things safe.

967
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:15,630
Yes.

968
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:17,330
AUDIENCE: When you
have a lead reactor--

969
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:23,623
or I don't know [INAUDIBLE] one
of these, but what is like--

970
00:48:23,623 --> 00:48:25,790
how do you cool the lead
once it starts getting hot?

971
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:27,165
MICHAEL SHORT:
Ah, good question.

972
00:48:27,165 --> 00:48:28,610
How do you cool the liquid lead?

973
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:31,010
You can't send liquid led
through a turbine, right?

974
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:33,260
So at some point you've got
to make steam and use that

975
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,550
to drive a turbine.

976
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:36,620
You can use what's
called a heat exchanger.

977
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:42,140
At its simplest, you can think
of it like a couple of tubes

978
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:45,160
where the lead is
going through here

979
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,670
and the steam is
going through here.

980
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,700
And they have a very thin
barrier between them,

981
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,870
so you have all this heat moving
from the lead, which is hotter,

982
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:58,838
to the steam, which is colder.

983
00:48:58,838 --> 00:49:01,130
They actually have built a
bunch of these led reactors.

984
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:01,910
AUDIENCE: Is that real?

985
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:02,702
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

986
00:49:02,702 --> 00:49:05,630
The Russian fast attack
subs, the alpha class subs,

987
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:08,870
were powered by and are
powered by liquid led reactors.

988
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:12,090
They're the only reactor
that can outrun a torpedo.

989
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:14,083
So when you have a liquid
lead reactor powering

990
00:49:14,083 --> 00:49:15,750
and you've got a panic
button that says,

991
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:16,950
forget the safety systems.

992
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:17,880
Outrun a torpedo.

993
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:21,240
You have a choice between maybe
dying in a reactor explosion

994
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:24,150
and definitely getting shot out
of the water with a torpedo.

995
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:25,620
You do whatever you can.

996
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,950
And these subs only run
two or three not slower

997
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:30,210
than a torpedo.

998
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:32,460
So just like that
old algebra problem,

999
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,730
if this guy leaves
Pittsburgh at 8 AM traveling

1000
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:38,220
40 miles an hour, and I'm
trying to get to Boston,

1001
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:41,640
30 miles an hour, if a
torpedo leaves one sub moving

1002
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,370
this velocity and the
alpha attack sub senses it

1003
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:45,870
from this distance
and starts moving

1004
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:48,330
at a similar velocity,
chances are the torpedo

1005
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:51,930
runs out of steam before
it reaches the alpha sub.

1006
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:54,390
And that's only because
they can have an extremely

1007
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:58,237
compact liquid lead nuclear
reactor at the power source.

1008
00:49:58,237 --> 00:50:01,060
AUDIENCE: So can
you [INAUDIBLE]??

1009
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:03,150
How do you move [INAUDIBLE]?

1010
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:04,810
MICHAEL SHORT: Good question.

1011
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:05,650
How do you use the--

1012
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:07,020
how do you move the liquid lead?

1013
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,760
You can move it by
natural convection

1014
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,500
but that's extremely slow.

1015
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,210
So there are multiple
ways of moving it.

1016
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:15,810
One of the cool ones is called
an EM or Electromagnetic pump.

1017
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:18,600
It induces eddy currents
in the liquid lead

1018
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,610
because it's also a conductor.

1019
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:24,690
And those eddy currents couple
with the EM field from the EM

1020
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:27,700
pump and cause the lead to
just start moving on its own.

1021
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,670
So it's a no moving parts pump.

1022
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:33,540
The only problem is it's
like 1% or 2% efficient.

1023
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:34,282
Yes.

1024
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:35,740
So they only use
those on the subs,

1025
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:40,000
but you can use EM pumps to
move conductive coolants.

1026
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,190
So I think it's pretty awesome.

1027
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:44,580
And there have there have
been land submarines.

1028
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:47,070
In fact, there's a company
called AKME Engineering

1029
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:49,040
in Russia that's
trying to commercialize

1030
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,630
a small modular
liquid lead reactor.

1031
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:54,390
The other nice thing about
these liquid metal coolants

1032
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:56,470
is you can make
the reactors much,

1033
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,880
much smaller and denser than
in a light water reactor.

1034
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,520
In a light water reactor,
you're relying on a lot of water

1035
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,290
to cool things
and a lot of water

1036
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:07,382
to be there to
moderate your neutrons.

1037
00:51:07,382 --> 00:51:09,840
In a liquid metal reactor,
where you don't need moderation,

1038
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,298
well, you don't
need-- all you need

1039
00:51:11,298 --> 00:51:13,040
is enough coolant
to keep things cool.

1040
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,248
So you can tighten stuff up
and make it more compact.

1041
00:51:17,223 --> 00:51:19,640
So that's one of the nuclear
startups coming out nowadays.

1042
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,860
This is an awesome
time to be in nuclear.

1043
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,800
When I started nuclear, there
were approximately exactly

1044
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,480
zero nuclear startups.

1045
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,550
Like TerraPower
didn't even exist yet.

1046
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:32,793
Now there's something
like 52 in the US

1047
00:51:32,793 --> 00:51:33,960
and others around the world.

1048
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,240
So like this is the time
to be in nuclear if you're

1049
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,360
up for startups and not
just working in academia,

1050
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,900
or a lab, or a big corporation.

1051
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,770
There's a lot of little
companies now doing

1052
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:48,385
some crazy things based on
some pretty good physics.

1053
00:51:48,385 --> 00:51:50,760
So maybe time for one more
question before I let you guys

1054
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,260
go.

1055
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:56,930
If not, then I'll see
you guys on Tuesday

1056
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:59,053
when we start radioactive decay.
