00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:23,690
MICHAEL SHORT: I
think I might actually

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,350
use all 16 colors today.

10
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,330
Oh no, this is the
most satisfying day.

11
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,260
Whereas Tuesday was probably
the most mathematically intense,

12
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,632
because we developed
this equation right here,

13
00:00:35,632 --> 00:00:37,340
today is going to be
the most satisfying,

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,280
because we are going to cancel
out just about every term,

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,940
leaving a homogeneous, infinite
reactor criticality condition.

16
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,860
So we will go over
today, how do you

17
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,970
go from this, to what is
criticality in a reactor?

18
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:54,680
So I want to get a couple
of variables up over here

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,440
to remind you guys.

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,330
We had this variable
flux of r, e,

21
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:05,300
omega, t in the
number of neutrons

22
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,020
per centimeter squared
per second traveling

23
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,120
through something.

24
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,060
And we also had its
corresponding non-angular

25
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,980
dependent term, on just
r, e, t, if we don't care

26
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,110
what angle things go through.

27
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,990
We've got a corresponding
variable called current.

28
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,290
So I'll put this as flux.

29
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:38,720
We have current j, r, e, omega,
t, and its corresponding,

30
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,390
we don't care about angle form.

31
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,060
And today, what
we're going to do

32
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,280
is first go over this
equation again so that we

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,690
understand all of its parts.

34
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,150
And there are more parts
here than are in the reading.

35
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,710
If you remember,
that's because I

36
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,100
wanted to show you how all
of these terms are created.

37
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,600
Just about every
one of these terms,

38
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,620
except the external source and
the flow through some surface,

39
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:08,669
has the form of some
multiplier, times the integral

40
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:12,930
over all possible variables
that we care about,

41
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,750
times a reaction rate d
stuff, where this reaction

42
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,660
rate is always going to be some
cross-section, times some flux.

43
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,480
So when you look at this
equation using that template,

44
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,310
it's actually not so bad.

45
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,130
So let's go through each
of these pieces right here.

46
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,320
And then we're going to
start simplifying things.

47
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,180
And this board's going to
look like some sort of rainbow

48
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:36,720
explosion.

49
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,080
But all that's going to be
left is a much simpler form

50
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,940
of the neutron
diffusion equation.

51
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,810
So we've got our
time-dependent term right here,

52
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,300
where I've stuck in
this variable flux,

53
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,700
instead of the
number of neutrons n,

54
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,360
because we know that flux
is the number of neutrons,

55
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,600
times the speed at
which they're moving.

56
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,850
And just to check
our units, flux

57
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:04,450
should be in neutrons per
centimeters squared per second.

58
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:11,100
And n is in neutrons
per cubic centimeter.

59
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:17,120
And velocity is in
centimeters per second.

60
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,160
So the units check out.

61
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,380
That's why I made that
substitution right there.

62
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,830
And this way, everything is in
terms of little fi, the flux.

63
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,240
We have our first term here.

64
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,120
I think I'll have
a labeling color.

65
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,720
That'll make things a
little easier to understand.

66
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,450
Which is due to
regular old fission.

67
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:39,650
In this case, we have new,
the number of neutrons created

68
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:44,570
per fission, times chi, the
sort of fission birth spectrum,

69
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,840
or at what energy the
neutrons are born.

70
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,630
Over 4pi would account for all
different angles in which they

71
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,680
could go out, times the integral
over our whole control volume,

72
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,265
and all other
energies in angles.

73
00:03:57,265 --> 00:03:58,640
If you remember
now, we're trying

74
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,500
to track the number of neutrons
in some small energy group, e,

75
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,940
traveling in some
small direction, omega.

76
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,110
And those have little
vector things on it

77
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,417
at some specific position
as a function of time.

78
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:14,750
So in order to figure out how
many neutrons are entering

79
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,820
our group from fission,
we need to know,

80
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,589
what are all the
fissions happening

81
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,310
in all the other groups?

82
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,730
I've also escalated this
problem a little bit

83
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,060
to not assume that the
reactor's homogeneous.

84
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,330
So I've added an r, or
a spatial dependence

85
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,528
for every cross-section
here, which

86
00:04:31,528 --> 00:04:33,320
means that as you move
through the reactor,

87
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,030
you might encounter
different materials.

88
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,250
You almost certainly
will, unless your reactor

89
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,470
has been in a blender.

90
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,790
So except for that
case, you would actually

91
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:44,390
have different cross sections in
different parts of the reactor.

92
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,890
So all of a sudden,
this is starting

93
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,830
to get awfully interesting,
or messy depending on what

94
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,150
you want to think about it.

95
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,760
There is the external
source, which is actually

96
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,910
a real phenomenon,
because reactors

97
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,430
do stick in those californium
kickstarter sources.

98
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,040
So for some amount
of time, there

99
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,140
is an external
source of neutrons,

100
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,050
giving them out with some
positional energy angle

101
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,260
and time dependence.

102
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,270
So let's call this the
kickstarter source.

103
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:19,720
There's this term right
here, the nin reactions.

104
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,550
So these are other reactions
where it's absorb a neutron,

105
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:29,420
and give off anywhere
between 2 and 4 neutrons.

106
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,460
Beyond that, it's
just not energetically

107
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,230
possible in a fission reactor.

108
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,880
But don't undergo fission.

109
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,730
They have their own cross
sections, their own birth

110
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,720
spectrum.

111
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,610
And I've stuck in
something right here,

112
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,460
if we have summing over all
possible i, where you have

113
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:48,920
this reaction be n in reaction,
where 1 neutron goes in,

114
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,790
and i neutrons come out.

115
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,450
You've got to multiply
by the number of neutrons

116
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,840
per reaction.

117
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,060
For fission, that was new.

118
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,875
For an nin reaction,
that's just i.

119
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,500
But otherwise, the
term looks the same.

120
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,490
You have your multiplier,
your birth spectrum, your 4pi,

121
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,730
your integral over stuff,
your unique cross-section,

122
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,530
and the flux.

123
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,920
And these two together
give you a reaction rate.

124
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,740
I've just written all of the
differentials as d stuff,

125
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,840
because it takes a lot
of time to write those

126
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,450
over and over again.

127
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:26,050
And then we have our
photo fission term,

128
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,520
where gamma rays of
sufficiently high energy

129
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,000
can also induce fission
external to the neutrons.

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,140
The term looks exactly the same.

131
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,350
There's going to be some
new for photofission,

132
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,510
some birth spectrum
for photofission,

133
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,090
some cross section for
photofission, and the same flux

134
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,430
that we're using
everywhere else.

135
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:53,120
Then we had what's called the in
scattering term, where neutrons

136
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,760
can undergo scattering,
lose some energy,

137
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,880
and enter our group
from somewhere else.

138
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,400
That's why we have
those en omega primes,

139
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,110
because it's some
other energy group.

140
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,320
And we have to account for
all of those energy groups.

141
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,570
That's why we have
this integral there.

142
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,470
And it looks very much the same.

143
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,530
There's a scattering
cross-section.

144
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,080
And that should actually
be an e prime right there.

145
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,570
Make sure I'm not
missing any more

146
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,110
of those inside the integral.

147
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,480
That's all good.

148
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,000
That's a prime, good.

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,020
There's also a flux.

150
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,180
And then there was this
probability function

151
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,780
that a given neutron
starting off an energy

152
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,926
e prime omega prime,
ends up scattering into r

153
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:40,460
energy, e and omega.

154
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,130
So this would be the other one.

155
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,100
And this would be r group.

156
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,530
But otherwise, the term
looks very much the same.

157
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,310
And that takes care of all
the possible gains of neutrons

158
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,630
into r group.

159
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,680
The losses are a
fair bit simpler.

160
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,490
There is reaction of
absolutely any kind.

161
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:08,770
Let's say this would be the
total cross-section, which

162
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,380
says that if a neutron
undergoes any reaction at all,

163
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,120
it's going to lose energy and
go out of our energy group d, e.

164
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,770
Notice here that these are all--

165
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,320
these energies and omega
is our all r group,

166
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,750
because we only care about
how many neutrons in r group

167
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,940
undergo a reaction and leave.

168
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,710
And the form is very simple--

169
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:31,130
integrate over volume,
energy, and direction,

170
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,700
times a cross-section,
times a flux,

171
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,559
just like all the other ones.

172
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,420
Then the only difference
in one right here

173
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,545
is what we'll call leakage.

174
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,120
These are neutrons moving
out of whatever control

175
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,370
surface that we're looking at.

176
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:53,790
And this can be some arbitrarily
complex control surface in 3D.

177
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,770
I don't really know how
to draw a blob in 3D.

178
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,380
But at every point
on that blob, there's

179
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,510
going to be a normal vector.

180
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,340
And you can then take the
current of neutrons traveling

181
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,280
out that normal vector, and
figure out how much of that

182
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,340
is actually leaving
our surface ds.

183
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,620
The one problem we had
is that everything here

184
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,000
is in terms of volume,
volume, volume, surface.

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,770
So we don't have
all the same terms,

186
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,410
because once we have everything
in the same variables

187
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,190
we can start to make some
pretty crazy simplifications.

188
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:33,830
The last thing we did is we
invoked the divergence theorem,

189
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:39,100
that says that the surface
integral of some variable FdS

190
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,750
is the same as the volume
integral of the divergence

191
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,167
of that variable dV.

192
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:49,250
So I remember there was
some snickering last time,

193
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,125
because you probably
haven't seen this since,

194
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,140
was it 1801 or 1802?

195
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,480
1802, OK, that makes sense,
because divergence usually

196
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,060
has more than one variable
associated with it.

197
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,560
I'll include the
dot, because that's

198
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,450
what makes that divergence.

199
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,790
So we can then
rewrite this term.

200
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,120
Let's start our
simplification colors.

201
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,210
That's our divergence theorem.

202
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,890
So let's get rid
of it in this form,

203
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:19,150
and call it minus integral
over all that stuff.

204
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:30,140
Then we'll have
dot, little j, to be

205
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:40,790
careful, r, e, omega, t, d soft.

206
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,290
So for every step, I"m going
to use a different color so you

207
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:48,407
can see which simplification led
to how much crossing stuff out.

208
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:49,990
And so like I said,
this board's going

209
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,330
to look like a
rainbow explosion.

210
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,872
But then we'll
rewrite it at the end.

211
00:10:52,872 --> 00:10:54,820
And it's going to look
a whole lot simpler.

212
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:59,437
So now, let's start making
some simplifications.

213
00:10:59,437 --> 00:11:01,270
Let's say you're an
actual reactor designer,

214
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,000
and all you care about is
how many neutrons are here.

215
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,650
Of the variables
here, which one do you

216
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,060
think we care the least about?

217
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,732
Angle, I mean do we really
care which direction

218
00:11:12,732 --> 00:11:13,690
the neutrons are going?

219
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,820
No, we pretty much
care, where are they?

220
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,400
And are they causing
fission or getting absorbed?

221
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,970
So let's start our
simplification board.

222
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:26,200
And in blue, we'll
neglect angle.

223
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,120
This is where it
starts to get fun.

224
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,440
So in this case, we'll just
perform the omega integral

225
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,880
over all angles.

226
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,610
We just neglect angle here.

227
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:41,170
We forget the omega
integral, forget omega there.

228
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,830
Away goes the 4pi, because we've
integrated overall 4pi star

229
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,200
radians, or all solid angle.

230
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,400
Let's just keep going.

231
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,100
Forget the 4pi,
forget the omega,

232
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:57,490
forget the omega, forget the 4pi
and the omega, and the omega.

233
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,690
Same thing here-- forget the
omega in the scattering kernel,

234
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,420
forget it in the
flux, forget it there,

235
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:09,300
forget it there,
and there as well.

236
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,775
OK, we've now completely
eliminated one variable.

237
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:14,650
And all we had to do is
ditch the 4pi and one

238
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,670
of the integrals.

239
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,300
What next?

240
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,370
We're tracking right now
every possible position,

241
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,280
every possible energy,
at every possible time.

242
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,280
If you want to know,
what is your flux

243
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,400
going to be in the reactor
at steady state, what

244
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,440
variable do you attack next?

245
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,520
Time.

246
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,950
So let's just say this
reactor is at steady state.

247
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,140
That's going to
invoke a few things.

248
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:50,250
For one, it's going to ditch
the entire steady state term.

249
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:54,240
We're going to get rid of
all the ts in all the fluxes.

250
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,220
This shouldn't take
too long to do.

251
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,960
I think that's all of them.

252
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,930
And the third thing is if this
reactor is at steady state,

253
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,420
chances are we've taken
our kickstarter source out,

254
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,230
because we just needed
it to get it going.

255
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,710
But the reactor should
be self-sustaining

256
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,310
once it's at steady state.

257
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:17,530
So let's just get rid
of our source term.

258
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,700
I just want to make sure
I didn't miss any here.

259
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:26,080
OK, next up, let's
go with green.

260
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,590
What else do you think we can
simplify about this problem?

261
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,370
Well, if you look far enough
away from the reactor,

262
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,700
we can make an assumption
that the reactor

263
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,500
is roughly homogeneous.

264
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,960
In some cases, it's not
so good of an assumption,

265
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,950
like very close to anything
that has a huge absorption

266
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,200
cross-section.

267
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,490
Now, I want to explain
the physics behind this.

268
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,890
If the neutrons travel
a very long distance

269
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:01,640
through any group of
materials, then those materials

270
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,900
will appear to be roughly
homogeneous to the neutrons.

271
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,900
If, however, the neutrons
travel through something that's

272
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,510
very different from the
materials around it,

273
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,500
then that homogeneous
assumption breaks down.

274
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,810
So in what locations in a
nuclear reactor do you think

275
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:22,770
you cannot treat the
system as homogeneous?

276
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,270
Where do the
properties of materials

277
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,260
suddenly change
by a huge amount?

278
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:26,760
Yeah, Luke?

279
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,420
AUDIENCE: Control rods.

280
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,130
MICHAEL SHORT:
Control rods, right,

281
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:34,515
so let's say it's
bad for control rods.

282
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:39,740
Where else?

283
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,538
How about the fuel?

284
00:14:49,538 --> 00:14:51,330
All of a sudden, you're
moving from a bunch

285
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,420
of structural materials
where sigma fission equals 0,

286
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,180
to the fuel where sigma fission,
like you saw on the test,

287
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,940
can be like 500 barns,
which even though it's

288
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,080
got a very small
exponent in front of it,

289
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,500
10 to the minus 22
centimeters squared,

290
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,910
it's still pretty significant.

291
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,020
So this assumption breaks
down around the control rods

292
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,325
and around the fuel.

293
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:12,450
But we can get around this.

294
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,960
Let's analyze the simplest,
craziest possible reactor,

295
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,270
which would be a molten
salt fueled reactor.

296
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:21,360
It's just a blob
of 700 Celsius goo

297
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,140
that's got its fuel, coolant,
and control rods all built in.

298
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,740
So if we assume that the
reactor is homogeneous, which

299
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,410
is a pretty good
assumption for molten salt

300
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,870
fueled reactors,
because the fuel's

301
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,460
dissolved in the coolant.

302
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,590
And it builds up its own
fission product poison.

303
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:41,250
So it's got some of its own
control rods kind of built in.

304
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,010
Usually, we'll have other
extra ones too, but whatever.

305
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:47,480
Then we can start to
really simplify things.

306
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,200
If we get rid of any
homogeneity assumptions,

307
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,860
we cannot necessarily get
rid of the r in the flux,

308
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,890
because even if the reactor's
homogeneous it still might have

309
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,330
boundaries.

310
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,100
So you might be able
to approximate it

311
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:09,060
as just a cylinder or a
slab of uniform materials.

312
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:17,610
But if we were to get rid of
the r's in the flux term, that

313
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:22,260
would mean that as we graph
flux as a function of distance,

314
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:28,052
it would look like that,
including infinitely far away

315
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:28,760
from the reactor.

316
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,970
Now, is was that true?

317
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:36,200
Absolutely not, so I don't want
to leave that up for anyone.

318
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,640
We'll fill in what these graphs
look like a little later,

319
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,820
just leave them there for now.

320
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,460
We can get rid of some
of the other r's though,

321
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,530
like these cross sections.

322
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,780
If the reactor is
actually homogeneous,

323
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,630
then the cross section
is the same everywhere

324
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,000
because the materials
are the same everywhere.

325
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,290
So we can get rid of the
r's here, the r's here,

326
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:04,109
and there, and there.

327
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:07,500
And that's it, I think.

328
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,510
I don't think I
missed any, good.

329
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:18,220
Next up-- if this
reactor is homogeneous,

330
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,650
then does it really
matter at which location

331
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,060
we're taking this balance?

332
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,609
Does it really matter
which little volume

333
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:30,070
element we're looking at?

334
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,320
We say these equations are--

335
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:39,490
we'll call them volume
identical, which

336
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,830
means if this same
equation is satisfied

337
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,200
at any point in the
reactor, we don't

338
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,127
need to do the volume integral
over the whole reactor.

339
00:17:47,127 --> 00:17:49,210
It's not like it's going
to change anywhere we go.

340
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:54,140
So forget the volume integrals.

341
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,800
Hopefully, you guys see
where I'm going with this.

342
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,730
And I've never tried teaching
it like this rainbow explosion

343
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:01,230
before.

344
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,470
But I'm kind of excited
to see how it turns out.

345
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:09,700
So already like 2/3 of the stuff
that we had written are gone.

346
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,930
What's the only variable
left that we can go after?

347
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:17,410
What's the only color left
that I haven't really used?

348
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:22,450
Energy, so we can make a couple
of different assumptions.

349
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:27,070
This equation as it is not yet
really analytically solvable,

350
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,040
because a lot of these
energy dependent terms

351
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,290
don't have analytical
solutions, or even

352
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,900
forms like the cross sections.

353
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,015
But we can start
attacking energy.

354
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,430
Hopefully, this is
different enough from white.

355
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,880
Yeah, is that big enough
difference for you guys to see?

356
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,687
Good, OK, we can start doing
this in a few different ways.

357
00:18:52,687 --> 00:18:54,020
I want to mention what they are.

358
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,410
And then we're going
to do the easiest one.

359
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:59,620
So the way it's done for real,
like in the computational

360
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,540
reactor physics
group, is you can

361
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:15,750
discretize the energy into a
bunch of little energy groups.

362
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,890
So you can write this equation
for every little energy group,

363
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,990
and assume that along
this energy scale,

364
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:27,600
ranging from your maximum energy
to probably thermal energy--

365
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:36,305
025, let's do this
clearly with thick chalk.

366
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,100
There we go.

367
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:47,680
You can then discretize into
some little energy group.

368
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:55,950
Let's say that's egi, that's egi
plus 1, and so on, and so on.

369
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,450
And depending on the type of
reactor that you're looking at,

370
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,760
and the energy
resolution that you need,

371
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,610
you choose the number of
energy groups accordingly.

372
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,840
Does anyone happen to know
for a light water reactor,

373
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,810
how many energy groups
do you think we need

374
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,600
to model a light water reactor?

375
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,060
The answer might surprise you.

376
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,640
It's just two, actually.

377
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,350
All we care about--

378
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:25,730
so let's say this would
be for the general case.

379
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,720
All we care about for
a light water reactor

380
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,635
is, are your neutrons thermal?

381
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,985
Or are they not?

382
00:20:37,985 --> 00:20:39,360
Because the neutrons
that are not

383
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,705
thermal are not contributing
to fission that much.

384
00:20:42,705 --> 00:20:43,830
They are just a little bit.

385
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,360
And you can account for those.

386
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,950
But pretty much, they're not.

387
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,640
Once the neutron slowdown down
to get thermal, in the range

388
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,620
from, let's say, about an
EV to that temperature--

389
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,650
took a surprising amount of time
to write with sidewalk chalk--

390
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,350
then you've got things that
are about 500 or 1,000 times

391
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,360
more likely to undergo fission.

392
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,810
And so all you care about is
the neutrons are all born.

393
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,850
They're all born
right about here.

394
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,800
And they scatter,
and bounce around.

395
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,510
And you don't care,
because they're just

396
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,215
in this not thermal region.

397
00:21:14,215 --> 00:21:15,840
And when they enter
the thermal region,

398
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,173
you start tracking them,
because those are the ones that

399
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:20,020
really count for fission.

400
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,320
And if you actually look up the
specifications for the AP 1000,

401
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,450
this is a modern reactor
under construction

402
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,580
in many different
places in the world.

403
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,370
When you see, how do they
do the neutron analysis?

404
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,150
Two group approximation.

405
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,150
So this isn't just
an academic exercise

406
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,610
to make it easier for
sophomores to understand.

407
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,310
This is actually something
that's done for real reactors.

408
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,830
So if you ever felt like
I'm making it too simple,

409
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,940
no, no, no, I'm simplifying
it down to what's really done.

410
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,810
And I will get you
that specification so

411
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:49,270
you can see what
Westinghouse says, like,

412
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,980
this is how we
design the reactor.

413
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,980
We made a two group
simplification in many cases.

414
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,730
So you can discretize.

415
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:02,400
You can forget it, which we're
going to call the one group

416
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,660
approximation.

417
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,630
Or you can-- let's say two group
is the other one that we're

418
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:12,280
actually going to tackle.

419
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,530
We're going to do this
one, forget energy.

420
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,440
But we're not really
going to forget energy,

421
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,340
because you can't
just pick an energy,

422
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,760
and pick a cross-section,
and say, OK,

423
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,190
that's the cross section
we're going to use.

424
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:34,430
If most cross sections
have the following form--

425
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:38,510
if this is log of energy,
and this is log of sigma,

426
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:46,420
and it goes something like
that, what energy do you pick?

427
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:46,920
Go ahead.

428
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,420
Tell me.

429
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,810
Which energy do you pick?

430
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:52,190
Anyone want to wager a guess?

431
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:55,210
AUDIENCE: The ones before
or after the big squigglies.

432
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,917
MICHAEL SHORT: The ones before
or after the big squiggles.

433
00:22:57,917 --> 00:23:00,250
I don't think that's correct,
because if you do it this,

434
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,320
then you're going away
underestimate fission.

435
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,120
If you do it here, you're going
to way overestimate fission,

436
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,950
or whatever other
reaction you have.

437
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,110
We didn't say which
reaction this is.

438
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,360
The rest of you who are
silent and afraid to speak up,

439
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,680
you're actually correct.

440
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,440
I wouldn't actually pick
any single value here.

441
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,320
What you need to do is find some
sort of average cross-section

442
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,900
for whatever reaction
that accurately

443
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,700
represents the
number of reactions

444
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,470
happening in the system.

445
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,290
And in order to do that, you
have to come up with some

446
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:32,500
average cross-section for
whatever reaction you have

447
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:39,370
by integrating over your whole
energy range of the energy

448
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:45,930
dependent cross-section
as a function of energy,

449
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:50,800
times your flux de over--

450
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,660
does this look
familiar from 1801 or 2

451
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:57,240
as well, what's the average
value of some function?

452
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,280
Little bit?

453
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,350
Well, we'll bring
it back here now.

454
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,930
So retrieve it from cold
storage in your memories,

455
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:09,590
because this is how actual
cross sections are averaged.

456
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,915
For whatever energy
range you're picking--

457
00:24:11,915 --> 00:24:13,790
I'm going to make this
a little more general.

458
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,470
I won't say zero.

459
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,110
I'll just say your minimum
energy for your group.

460
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,460
So now, this equation is general
for the multi group and the one

461
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,560
group and two group method.

462
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,160
For whatever cross-section
you want to pick

463
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,120
and whatever energy
range you're looking at,

464
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,820
you take the actual data
and perform an average

465
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,640
for the fast and
thermal delineation,

466
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,800
where, let's say this is
fast and this is thermal,

467
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,450
you would have two
different averages.

468
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:50,287
Maybe this average
would be right there.

469
00:24:50,287 --> 00:24:50,870
You know what?

470
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:55,880
Let's use white so it
actually has some contrast.

471
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,210
So this would be one value
of the cross-section.

472
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:02,000
And maybe the next average
would be right there.

473
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,140
So you simplify this
absolutely non analytical form

474
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,100
of your complicated
cross-section

475
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,070
to just a couple of values.

476
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:15,290
Maybe we'll call that
average sigma fast.

477
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:19,925
And we'll call that
average sigma thermal.

478
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,580
So using this analogy
and this color,

479
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,310
we can then say,
we're going to take

480
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:35,900
an average new, an average
chi, get rid of the energies,

481
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,030
because we can perform
the same energy average

482
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:42,000
integration on every quantity
with energy dependence.

483
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,910
So all we do is we
put a bar there,

484
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,270
ditch the energies,
ditch the energies.

485
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:50,910
And let's just say that flux
is going to be what it is.

486
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:55,330
Same thing here--
yeah, same thing there,

487
00:25:55,330 --> 00:26:00,710
and there, and there, there,
there, there, here, and here,

488
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,832
and here.

489
00:26:01,832 --> 00:26:03,040
And there is a cross-section.

490
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,480
There is an energy.

491
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,450
There is an energy.

492
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,550
There is a cross-section.

493
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,470
We don't care about
those anymore.

494
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:13,250
And there's a couple of other
implications of this energy

495
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,601
simplification.

496
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,960
What is the birth spectrum now?

497
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,700
What's the probability
that a neutron

498
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:35,430
is born in our energy group
which contains all energies?

499
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:43,700
1, OK, so forget the chi,
and that one, and that one.

500
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,380
And what about this
scattering kernel?

501
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,740
What's the probability
that a neutron scatters

502
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,260
from any other energy which
is already in our group

503
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,988
into our group, which
contains all energies?

504
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,856
AUDIENCE: 1.

505
00:26:56,856 --> 00:26:58,900
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
scattering no longer

506
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,570
matters when you do the
one group approximation,

507
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,970
because if the neutron
loses some of its energy,

508
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,520
it's still in our energy
group, because our energy

509
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,680
group contains all energies.

510
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:14,490
So forget the scattering kernel.

511
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:18,910
And forget the energy integrals.

512
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:21,920
What are we actually left with?

513
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,750
Not much.

514
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,810
There's no green in here yet.

515
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,560
Good, because I need
to do one more thing.

516
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,400
There is no more green.

517
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,210
Oh, we did green.

518
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:32,870
We did time.

519
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:37,650
OK, green, red, orange--
is this the orange I used?

520
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,900
Dammit.

521
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,650
OK, we use those.

522
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,120
Purple, no, we've used it.

523
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,650
Oh my God.

524
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,230
We've used both blues.

525
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,600
Bright yellow.

526
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,340
Yeah?

527
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,215
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

528
00:27:49,215 --> 00:27:50,370
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

529
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,590
Chi is the fission
birth spectrum,

530
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:56,250
the probability that a neutron
is born at any given energy.

531
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,250
But because all neutrons are
born in our energy group, which

532
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,632
contains all energies, then that
just becomes one and goes away.

533
00:28:02,632 --> 00:28:04,590
There's no birth spectrum,
because they're just

534
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,730
born in our group.

535
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,380
Does that makes sense?

536
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:11,310
OK, I think I found the actual
only color, besides black

537
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:15,180
on a black chalkboard, and
white which we already have,

538
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,440
that I have left.

539
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,343
We also have a slightly
darker shade of gray.

540
00:28:18,343 --> 00:28:19,260
But I'm literally out.

541
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:23,607
This worked out awesome,
because there's one more thing

542
00:28:23,607 --> 00:28:24,690
that we want to deal with.

543
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:30,470
What do we even have left?

544
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,410
All right, what is
the one term that

545
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,900
is not in all of the same
variables as the others?

546
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,660
That current, that j.

547
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,040
What do we do about that?

548
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,880
So we're going-- sorry?

549
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,362
AUDIENCE: The F e to e.

550
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:51,570
MICHAEL SHORT: The F e to e--

551
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,720
so, actually, I'll recreate
some of our variables

552
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,690
here, because there's
a lot of them.

553
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:02,610
So our F of e prime
to e is what's

554
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,960
called the scattering kernel.

555
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,050
And that's the
probability that a neutron

556
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,690
scatters from some other
energy group, e prime,

557
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:18,110
into ours in e about de.

558
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:22,790
And chi of e is the
fission birth spectrum.

559
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:34,070
And just for
completeness, knew of e

560
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:41,474
is our neutron multiplier,
or neutrons per fission.

561
00:29:41,474 --> 00:29:44,040
And I think that gives a
pretty complete explanation

562
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,450
of what's up here.

563
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,120
So now, let's figure out how
to deal with the current term.

564
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,450
This is when we make one of
the biggest approximations

565
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:54,120
here, and go from what's
called the neutron transport

566
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,550
equation, which is a fully
accurate physical model

567
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:00,100
of what's really going on, to
the neutron diffusion equation.

568
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:09,180
And this is where
it gets really fun.

569
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:12,750
You don't assume that neutrons
are subatomic particles that

570
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,630
are whizzing about and knocking
off of everything else.

571
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:18,930
You then treat the neutrons
kind of like a gas,

572
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,520
or like a chemical.

573
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,870
And you just say that it
follows the laws of diffusion.

574
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:27,240
Again, this works out very
well, except for places

575
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,390
where cross sections suddenly
change, like near control

576
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,890
rods or near fuel.

577
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,750
But for most of the
reactor, especially

578
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,240
if we have a molten
salt fuel reactor,

579
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,190
we can invoke what's
called Fick's law.

580
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:42,330
Does this sound
familiar to anyone?

581
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:49,020
Fick's law diffusion,
3091 or 5111.

582
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,480
It's the change of a
chemical down a density

583
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,720
or a concentration gradient.

584
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,950
So, yeah, you've got the idea.

585
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:59,190
What Fick's law says
is that the current--

586
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,410
or let's say the diffusion
current or the neutron

587
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:02,470
current--

588
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:05,160
is going to be equal
to some diffusion

589
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,500
coefficient, times the
gradient of whatever

590
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,090
chemical concentration
you've got.

591
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:14,830
Let me put the c in there.

592
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,585
So right here, this
would be the current.

593
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:18,730
I'll label it in
a different color.

594
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:26,200
This would be your
variable of interest.

595
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:33,180
Maybe c is for concentration,
or phi is for flux.

596
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,070
Oh, that reminds me, where
are those bars on our flux?

597
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,080
Which term did we do?

598
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,740
Energy-- where's my slightly
lighter blue over here?

599
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:48,880
All of these phi's
become capital,

600
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,280
because we've gotten rid of
all the angular, and energy,

601
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,840
and everything dependence.

602
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,950
Oh, angular dependence--
neglect omega,

603
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,390
that should be dark blue.

604
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:05,810
Omega goes away.

605
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:07,340
And the fluxes become capital.

606
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,940
So many terms to keep track of.

607
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,430
Luckily, you will never have to.

608
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:18,120
And then the j
becomes a capital J.

609
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,630
Did I miss any phi's here?

610
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:25,300
No, because that one
was already gone, cool.

611
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,730
All right, so we
can use Fick's law,

612
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:31,893
and transform the current into
something related to flux.

613
00:32:31,893 --> 00:32:34,060
And what we're saying here
is that we're getting rid

614
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,620
of the true physics, which is
that there's some fixed neutron

615
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,120
current.

616
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,720
And we're saying that neutrons
behave kind of like a gas,

617
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,730
or a chemical in solution.

618
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:49,120
And so in yellow, we can ditch
our current related term,

619
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,920
and rewrite it.

620
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:56,780
We don't have any integrals
left, as negative del squared

621
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,790
phi.

622
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:07,220
I think the only variable
left is r, not too bad.

623
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,780
Now, we have a second
order linear differential

624
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,250
equation describing the flow
of neutrons in the system.

625
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,700
And so we actually
have something

626
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,760
that we can solve for flux.

627
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,620
I think it's time to rewrite it.

628
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,880
Wouldn't you say?

629
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,260
This has been fun.

630
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:28,640
So let's rewrite what's left.

631
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,740
Make sure you guys can
actually see everything there.

632
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,910
We'll write it in
boring old white.

633
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:41,040
So we have no
transient dependence.

634
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:50,630
We have left sigma fission,
times flux, as a function of r.

635
00:33:50,630 --> 00:34:01,890
No source, and we have our
neutron nin reactions of--

636
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:05,790
oh, we forgot our
new sigma fission.

637
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:12,954
Then we have our i sigma
fission from nin, times flux.

638
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:20,340
Next term, we have photofission.

639
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:24,420
So we have a new,
from gamma rays,

640
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:28,580
times sigma fission from
gamma rays, times flux.

641
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:32,350
Next up, we have--

642
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:35,770
well, last
simplification to make.

643
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:37,230
We have scattering.

644
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:40,300
And we have total cross-section.

645
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,030
When we said,
forget about energy,

646
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,110
and our scattering
kernel becomes one--

647
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,429
and that's light blue--

648
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:51,270
got to make one more
modification to this board.

649
00:34:55,409 --> 00:35:00,750
Do we care about scattering
at all anymore whatsoever?

650
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,160
Because scattering doesn't
change the number of neutrons

651
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:03,660
left.

652
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:09,340
So we can then take
these two terms

653
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:18,230
and just call it sigma
absorption, times flux,

654
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:22,130
because if we take scattering,
minus the total cross-section,

655
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,380
it's like saying, all that's
left if you don't scatter

656
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,910
is you absorb.

657
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:30,210
And if you remember, I'll
add to the energy pile,

658
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,420
we said that our
total cross section

659
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,150
is scattering, plus absorption.

660
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:44,460
And absorption could
be fission and capture.

661
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,920
And capture could be--

662
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,650
let's say, capture
with nothing happens,

663
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:55,080
plus these nin reactions,
plus any other capture

664
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,970
reaction that does something.

665
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:59,640
So we're going to use this
cross-section identity right

666
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,330
here with a couple
of minus signs on it.

667
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:06,120
And say, well,
scattering minus total,

668
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:12,175
leaves you with negative
absorption, to simplify terms.

669
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:19,340
I'll leave that up there
for everyone to see.

670
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,930
So then we have scattering
and total just becomes

671
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:31,200
minus sigma absorption,
times phi of r.

672
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,730
And we're left with--

673
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:33,420
what was that?

674
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,820
Current, that becomes plus.

675
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,950
There is a d missing
in there, isn't there?

676
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:51,250
A yellow d, minus d.

677
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:55,210
OK, and that's it.

678
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:55,710
Yes?

679
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,040
AUDIENCE: What is d?

680
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,160
MICHAEL SHORT: d is the
diffusion coefficient

681
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,450
right here.

682
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:04,110
So we're assuming
that neutrons diffuse

683
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:11,690
like a gas or a chemical with
some diffusion coefficient.

684
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,150
And so we'll define
what that is, oh,

685
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,580
probably next class, because
we have seven minutes.

686
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,625
Yeah, Luke?

687
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:20,803
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

688
00:37:20,803 --> 00:37:21,720
MICHAEL SHORT: Uh-huh.

689
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,325
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

690
00:37:25,325 --> 00:37:26,950
MICHAEL SHORT: The
c right here, that's

691
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,440
whatever variable
we're tracking.

692
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,140
So let's call that flux.

693
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:35,710
Or let's call it n,
the number of neutrons,

694
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:41,390
because flux is just number
of neutrons times velocity.

695
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,270
So let's say that
the concentration was

696
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,300
the concentration of neutrons.

697
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,500
And we just multiply by
their velocity to get flux.

698
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,050
So it's almost like we can
say that the concentration

699
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:53,292
of neutrons is directly
related to the flux.

700
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:55,000
And that way, we have
everything in flux.

701
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,590
And that's the entire
neutron diffusion equation.

702
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:13,050
Yeah, this is for one group
with all the assumptions we

703
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:18,710
made right here, homogeneous.

704
00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:23,590
What other assumptions
did we make?

705
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:32,050
Steady state, and we
already neglected that.

706
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:35,120
And I think that's enough
qualifiers for this.

707
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,070
But it's directly
from this equation

708
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,440
right here that we can
develop what's called

709
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,450
our criticality condition.

710
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:46,750
Under what conditions
is the reactor critical?

711
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,880
So in this case,
by critical, we're

712
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,380
going to have some variable
called k effective,

713
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:56,290
which defines the
number of neutrons

714
00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:00,100
produced over the number
of neutrons consumed.

715
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:04,480
And if k effective
equals 1, then we

716
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,890
say that the
reactor is critical.

717
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,050
That means that exactly the
number of neutrons produced

718
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:16,850
by regular fission, nin
reactions, and photofission

719
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:19,070
equals exactly the
number of neutrons

720
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:23,180
absorbed in the anything,
and that leak out.

721
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:27,980
So let's relabel our terms in
the same font that we did here.

722
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:31,850
So this would be
the fission term.

723
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:35,350
This would be nin reactions.

724
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,580
This would be photofission.

725
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,010
This would be absorption.

726
00:39:44,948 --> 00:39:45,865
This would be leakage.

727
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:51,820
How many neutrons get out
of our finite boundary?

728
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,560
And if you remember
when we started out,

729
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,450
we said we were going to make
the neutron balance equation

730
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,355
equal to gains minus losses.

731
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,630
And through our rainbow
explosion simplification,

732
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,800
we've done exactly that.

733
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:11,525
These are your gains.

734
00:40:15,138 --> 00:40:16,055
These are your losses.

735
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:22,130
When gains minus
losses equals zero,

736
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,670
the reactor's in
perfect balance.

737
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,170
Yep?

738
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:28,370
AUDIENCE: How does leakage
come out to be negative?

739
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:30,620
MICHAEL SHORT: Leakage
comes out to be negative,

740
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,400
despite the plus sign here.

741
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,340
And that's actually intentional.

742
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,740
That's because
neutrons traveled down

743
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,700
the concentration gradient.

744
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,360
So let's say we're going
to draw an imaginary flux

745
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,460
spectrum that's going
to be quite correct.

746
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,710
And I'm doing all of those
features for a reason.

747
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,990
But let's look at the
concentration gradient

748
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:50,000
right here.

749
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:59,280
Leakage is positive when your
flux gradient is negative.

750
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,850
That's why the sign is
flipped right there.

751
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:07,160
So a positive
diffusion term means

752
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,300
you have neutrons leaking out
down a negative concentration

753
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:15,710
gradient, because if you look at
the slope here, the change in x

754
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,450
is positive.

755
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,970
And the change in
flux is negative.

756
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,590
So the slope is negative.

757
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,450
Concentration
gradient is negative.

758
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:25,070
That's why the sign
is the opposite

759
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,698
of what you may expect.

760
00:41:26,698 --> 00:41:28,740
And the same thing goes
for chemical, or gaseous,

761
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,122
or any other kind of diffusion.

762
00:41:30,122 --> 00:41:31,830
I'm glad you asked,
because that's always

763
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:35,370
a point of confusion, is,
why is there that plus sign?

764
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,330
That's intentional
And that's correct.

765
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:37,830
Cool.

766
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:41,370
Yeah, Shawn?

767
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,910
AUDIENCE: So in
that case, if you

768
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,550
were to explicitly
right out losses,

769
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:48,512
would it be minus
absorption, plus leakage?

770
00:41:48,512 --> 00:41:50,220
MICHAEL SHORT: Let's
put some parentheses

771
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:58,360
on here, equals
zero, and a minus.

772
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,910
And when we say plus leakage,
we have that plus sign in there.

773
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,910
So I'm not going to put
any parentheses up here,

774
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:05,590
because that
wouldn't be correct.

775
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:10,300
But what I can say is
that gains minus losses

776
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:15,610
have to be in perfect balance to
have a k effective equal to 1.

777
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,110
Does anyone else
have any questions,

778
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,496
before I continue
the explanation?

779
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:21,740
Cool.

780
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,720
Let's say you're
producing more neutrons

781
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,630
than you're destroying.

782
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,310
That's what we
call supercritical.

783
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,930
So I just did an
interview for this K

784
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:36,450
through 12 outreach program.

785
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:38,730
And they said, should
people be afraid

786
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:42,090
when something, quote
unquote, goes critical?

787
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:44,140
Sounds scary emotionally, right?

788
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,550
And the answer is
absolutely not.

789
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:47,370
If you're reactor goes
critical, it's turned on.

790
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:48,537
And it's in perfect balance.

791
00:42:48,537 --> 00:42:50,010
That's exactly what you want.

792
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:52,230
So going critical is
not a scary thing.

793
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,850
It means we have control.

794
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:56,790
If something goes supercritical,
it doesn't necessarily

795
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:58,560
mean it's out of control.

796
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,440
Reactors can be very
slightly supercritical

797
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,120
and still in control,
because of what's

798
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,880
called delayed neutrons, which
I will not introduce today,

799
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,650
because we have two minutes.

800
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,980
If a reactor has a k
effective of less than one,

801
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,300
we call that subcritical.

802
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:18,730
So it's important to note that
the nuclear terminology that's

803
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:22,060
kind of leaked out
into our vernacular

804
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,970
is not physically correct,
in the way that it's used.

805
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:29,500
Words like critical are used
to incite emotions, and bring

806
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,160
about fear.

807
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,670
When to a nuclear
engineer critical means,

808
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:35,590
in perfect control,
in balance, like

809
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,100
you would expect,
or in equilibrium.

810
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,860
That all sounds
kind of nice, makes

811
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:40,660
you calm down a little bit.

812
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,490
Yeah, so we can
put one last term

813
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:48,670
in front of our
criticality condition.

814
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:53,330
We can take either the gains or
the losses, move the equal sign

815
00:43:53,330 --> 00:44:00,750
and zero over a little bit, and
put a 1 over k effective here.

816
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:05,070
This, then, perfectly
describes the difference

817
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:08,610
between the gains and
the losses in a reactor.

818
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:13,050
So if the gains equal the
losses, then k effective

819
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,170
must equal 1.

820
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:16,440
And the reactor has
got to be in balance.

821
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,390
If there are more
gains than losses,

822
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,930
which means if you are
producing more neutrons then

823
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:24,570
you're consuming,
than k effective must

824
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:30,600
be greater than 1 for this
equation to still equal zero,

825
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,530
because this equation
must be satisfied.

826
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:35,630
So if you're making
more neutrons,

827
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:38,280
your k effective has got
to be greater than 1.

828
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,360
So you have a less than
1 multiplier in front.

829
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:45,380
And on the opposite side, if
you're losing more neutrons

830
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,890
then you're gaining, your k
effective has to be less than 1

831
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:51,680
to make this equation balanced.

832
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,380
Going along with all these
definitions right here.

833
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,870
So it's exactly 5 of 5 of.

834
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:02,470
I've given you delivered
promised blackboard of Lucky

835
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:03,760
Charms.

836
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,400
And we've hit a
perfect spot, which

837
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,060
is the one group homogeneous
steady state neutron diffusion

838
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,250
equation, from
which we can develop

839
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:15,220
our criticality conditions
and solve this much

840
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:19,270
simpler equation to get
the flux profiles that I've

841
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:20,812
started to draw here.

842
00:45:20,812 --> 00:45:23,020
So I want to stop here, and
take any questions on any

843
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,450
of the terms you see here.

844
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:24,950
Yeah?

845
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:27,700
AUDIENCE: Didn't we talk a lot
about the different energies,

846
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:31,320
like the one-group, two-group,
or the discrete distributed

847
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,403
discretized energy groups?

848
00:45:32,403 --> 00:45:33,820
So when we're doing
the one group,

849
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:35,890
you're actually just
treating them fast together?

850
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:36,310
MICHAEL SHORT: We are.

851
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:36,852
That's right.

852
00:45:36,852 --> 00:45:38,920
AUDIENCE: To know
that, like you said,

853
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,925
the reactors do two group
in the actual analysis.

854
00:45:41,925 --> 00:45:44,050
MICHAEL SHORT: So a lot a
lot of reactors, at least

855
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:46,660
thermal reactors where you only
care if neutrons are thermal

856
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,820
or not, two group is enough.

857
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:51,590
When you have a one group
or a two group equation,

858
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:54,718
these are fairly
analytically solvable things.

859
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:56,260
You get to any more
groups than that,

860
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,940
and, yes, they're
analytically solvable.

861
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:58,870
But it gets horrible.

862
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:00,940
And that's why we
have computers to do

863
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,190
the sorts of repetitive
calculations over and over

864
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:04,210
again.

865
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:06,800
Once we've solved the
one group equation,

866
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,180
I'll then show you intuitive
ways to write, but not solve,

867
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:15,280
the equations for
multi group equations.

868
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,280
Sure.

869
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,531
Any other questions?

870
00:46:21,932 --> 00:46:23,890
So like I promised, we
didn't stay complex for,

871
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:25,740
long because there's
basically nothing left.

872
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:26,440
Yeah?

873
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,930
AUDIENCE: What is
the 2n over 2t?

874
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:30,770
Are we saying that?

875
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:33,430
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, that's
a partial derivative.

876
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:37,520
Yeah, there we go.

877
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,630
So this is saying a change
in neutron population,

878
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:45,480
or the partial derivative
of n with respect to t,

879
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,210
because n varies with
space, energy, angle, time,

880
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:52,070
and anything else you
could possibly think about,

881
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:53,750
equals the gains
minus the losses.

882
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:01,920
I think this is
worthy of a t-shirt.

883
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,170
If any of you guys would
like to update the department

884
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:07,110
shirts to properly take
into account photofission

885
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:09,840
external sources
and nin reactions,

886
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:13,860
I think it would make for a
much more impressive thing,

887
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:18,840
because we kind of printed
an oversimplification before.

888
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,680
It's too bad.

889
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,180
We definitely had
room on the shirt.

890
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,180
There was room on the
sides, and on the sleeves.

891
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:26,687
Yeah, keep going.

892
00:47:26,687 --> 00:47:28,020
It might have to be long sleeve.

893
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,478
I think that would
be pretty sweet.

894
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:38,080
Yeah, OK, if no one else
has any immediate questions,

895
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,780
you'll have plenty
of time tomorrow,

896
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,447
because the whole
goal tomorrow is going

897
00:47:41,447 --> 00:47:42,760
to be to solve this equation.

898
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,350
That's only going to
take like 20 minutes.

899
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:48,310
So we can do a quick review
of the simplification

900
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:50,140
of the neutron
transport equation,

901
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:52,355
solve the neutron
diffusion equation.

902
00:47:52,355 --> 00:47:53,980
If you have questions,
we'll spend time

903
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,210
to answer them there.

904
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:57,910
And if you don't, we'll move
on to writing multi group

905
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:59,200
equations.

906
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,500
And also Friday for recitation,
it's electron microscope time.

907
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,440
So now that you guys have
learned different electron

908
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,962
interactions with matter,
you're going to see them.

909
00:48:07,962 --> 00:48:10,420
So we're going to be analyzing
a couple of different pieces

910
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,717
of materials that a couple of
you are going to get to select.

911
00:48:13,717 --> 00:48:15,550
And we're going to image
them with electrons

912
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:19,600
to show how you can beat the
wavelength of light imaging

913
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,067
limit, like I told you before.

914
00:48:21,067 --> 00:48:22,900
We're going to produce
our own X-ray spectra

915
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,650
to analyze them
elementally, where

916
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:25,900
you'll see the bremsstrahlung.

917
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,730
You'll see the
characteristic peaks.

918
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:30,990
And you'll see a couple of other
features that I'll explain too.

919
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:34,416
So get ready for
some SEM tomorrow.
