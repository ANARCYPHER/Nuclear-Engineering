8
00:00:22,183 --> 00:00:24,600
PROFESSOR: I wanted to do a
quick review of all the photon

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,767
interactions, because I've
released problems at 5:00

10
00:00:26,767 --> 00:00:28,380
for you guys.

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,701
It involves your banana data.

12
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:32,159
So we're going to be taking a
second look at all the banana

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,850
data and the problem statement
for the lab part is simple.

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,680
Identify all the peaks.

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,888
Tell me where they came from.

16
00:00:38,888 --> 00:00:40,805
And tell me all the peaks
that should be there

17
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:42,000
that you don't see and why.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,090
And that's like a quarter of
the problem set or something.

19
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,670
So just to review
the three effects

20
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,070
that we talked about sort
of in order of what energies

21
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,350
they're important in,
my spelling I'm sure

22
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,090
will be slower than usual today.

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,300
I spent like 3 and
1/2 days listening

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:09,030
to Russian presentations with an
English translator microphone.

25
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,008
Russian scientific presentation
is really similar to English.

26
00:01:13,008 --> 00:01:14,550
All the technical
words are the same,

27
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,967
but as soon as you start trying
to talk to a two-year-old,

28
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:17,910
you're just lost.

29
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,230
But it's pretty cool.

30
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,700
So we went over the
photoelectric effect,

31
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:28,818
Compton scattering,
and pair production.

32
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,720
And so in addition to
knowing what these three

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,020
mechanisms actually are and how
to tell what they would look

34
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,270
like on a given
detector spectrum,

35
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,953
the other two important
things we wanted to remember

36
00:01:42,953 --> 00:01:44,620
are what are the
cross-sections, so what

37
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,290
are the relative probabilities
of each happening

38
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,860
as a function of their energy
the photon and the material

39
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,310
that they're going in and then
filling in this map of if you

40
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:59,337
have energy and z, where are
these effects most prevalent?

41
00:01:59,337 --> 00:02:00,670
Does anyone want to kick me off?

42
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,250
Does anyone remember the general
form of the cross-sections

43
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,048
for any of these effects?

44
00:02:06,048 --> 00:02:08,090
Or does anyone remember
what this map looks like?

45
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,260
Yeah?

46
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,142
Chris.

47
00:02:14,142 --> 00:02:15,560
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

48
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,437
PROFESSOR: Indeed.

49
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:18,690
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

50
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,690
PROFESSOR: That's right.

51
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,370
So pair production--

52
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,830
I think we gave it
the symbol kappa

53
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,230
to go along with a reading
that you guys have--

54
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,510
was around here.

55
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,745
That's because it's not going
to happen below 1.022 MeV,

56
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:34,120
because you need the energy
to make the positron electron

57
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,900
pair.

58
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,570
And indeed, the more electrons
there are in each atom,

59
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,690
the more likely
pair production is,

60
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,390
this happens when the photon
gets near the nucleus, which

61
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,690
is going to have a higher
charge for higher z and so on.

62
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,560
And so pair production,
it was proportional to--

63
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,590
you'll never need to
know the exact things

64
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,590
that the cross-sections.

65
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,880
That's what books are for.

66
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,190
But it was proportional to--

67
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:02,770
let's see, I think it was
like z to the third or fourth,

68
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,050
pretty strong like that.

69
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,370
What about Compton scattering?

70
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,764
Where does that lie on this map?

71
00:03:08,764 --> 00:03:10,942
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

72
00:03:10,942 --> 00:03:12,400
PROFESSOR: Yup,
high z, low energy.

73
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,840
So in this general region.

74
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,550
We'll just give it a C
for Compton scattering.

75
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,510
And in that one,
the cross-section

76
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,610
was proportional
to something like 1

77
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,510
over the energy or h bar
omega in your reading.

78
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,520
That's the same thing
as saying photon energy.

79
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,960
And then what about
photoelectric effect?

80
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,732
Well, that's the only
place there is left, right?

81
00:03:34,732 --> 00:03:35,940
We'll give it the symbol tau.

82
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,210
So I'll put these up here.

83
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,790
I don't quite know why
they chose those symbols.

84
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,100
But I'll just stick to the
notation in the reading.

85
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,710
And then the idea here is this
was proportional to something

86
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:53,190
like z to the fifth over--

87
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,280
what is it, like
energy to the like 7/2.

88
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,640
So significantly low energy,
significantly high z.

89
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,320
And does anyone
remember at what energy

90
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,390
does the photoelectric
effect start to kick in?

91
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,720
Very close to zero.

92
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,700
So here, the energy has got to
be greater than or equal to,

93
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,349
but what is the photoelectric
effect physically?

94
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:20,695
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

95
00:04:20,695 --> 00:04:21,320
PROFESSOR: Yep.

96
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,910
A gamma gets absorbed,
or any photon

97
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,800
gets absorbed that
knocks out an electron.

98
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,748
So how energetic does it have
to be to knock out the electron?

99
00:04:27,748 --> 00:04:30,040
STUDENT: Binding energy
of the electrons.

100
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,320
PROFESSOR: The binding energy
of the lowest bound electron,

101
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,770
which we give that symbol
phi or the work function.

102
00:04:41,218 --> 00:04:43,510
The idea here is that as soon
as you have enough energy

103
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,130
to eject the outermost
electron, which

104
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,330
is super low for the alkali
metals, like sodium, potassium,

105
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,090
cesium, then you can
exceed the work function

106
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,370
and get the photoelectric
effect going.

107
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,200
And for this one, we
said the energy here

108
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,740
has to be greater than or
equal to 2 times the rest

109
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:06,126
mass of the electron c squared,
better known as 1.022 MeV.

110
00:05:06,126 --> 00:05:11,130
Is there a minimum energy
for Compton scattering?

111
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,180
Photons can scatter.

112
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,580
They don't have to have
any energy to scatter.

113
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,700
Certainly.

114
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,410
And let's see the two
interesting bits of technology

115
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,790
we talked about
related to these,

116
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,370
one was called a Compton
camera, where you could actually

117
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,680
use two detectors.

118
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,130
Let's say you're looking for
a tiny source in a big box

119
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,910
somewhere.

120
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,410
You can have one detector.

121
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,290
And you can have
a second detector,

122
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,430
so that this source is sending
out gammas in all directions.

123
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,420
And let's say one of them
interacts with detector one,

124
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,800
bounces off, and
interacts in detector two.

125
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,660
At that point,
you've constrained

126
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,750
sort of the angle
between these detectors,

127
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,570
so that you know what
energy the gamma came from.

128
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,260
And you know generally where
it came from physically, which

129
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,290
is a cool piece of equipment.

130
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,898
I'm going to try
to find pictures

131
00:06:01,898 --> 00:06:03,940
of one of these actual
things, because I actually

132
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,270
haven't seen one myself.

133
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,437
I've just heard it described
physically and it seems

134
00:06:07,437 --> 00:06:08,130
to make sense.

135
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,280
And the second one
that we touched upon

136
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,760
at the very end of last class
had to do with this thing right

137
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,260
here.

138
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,220
Does anyone remember
thermionic devices?

139
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,110
Well, the work function
for some materials,

140
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,410
like for cesium,
the work function

141
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,170
is a little less than an eV.

142
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,930
It's like 0.7
electron volts, which

143
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,750
means when you get things
up to about 2,000 Celsius

144
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,348
or so, the temperature
of the atoms themselves

145
00:06:34,348 --> 00:06:36,640
exceeds the work function,
and the outer electrons just

146
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,900
boil off.

147
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:45,220
So if you have two pieces of
material, probably in a vacuum,

148
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,700
and one of them is like 2,000 C,
and one of them is, let's say,

149
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:54,130
room temperature, you end up
with this net flux of electrons

150
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,035
boiling off the hot
one to the cold one.

151
00:06:56,035 --> 00:06:57,910
And this has been one
of the methods proposed

152
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,800
to directly convert
heat to electricity

153
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,900
for ultra high
temperature applications,

154
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,940
like space reactors
or other things that

155
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,190
can get super crazy hot.

156
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,560
So it's one of those energy
conversion mechanisms-- did

157
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,180
anyone ever hear about
this one in high school?

158
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,810
Highly, highly doubt that
it would ever be mentioned.

159
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,930
One of the professors in our
department, Elias Gyftopoulos

160
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,290
was one of the folks that
came up with this whole idea.

161
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,520
And in my senior design
course, we actually

162
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,280
designed a space reactor
that uses thermionics,

163
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,550
and he showed up in the
audience by surprise.

164
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,258
And that's probably
the dumbest I've ever

165
00:07:31,258 --> 00:07:33,250
looked at a presentation,
explaining something

166
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,600
that someone invented.

167
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,960
They knew every single mistake
and everything that was wrong.

168
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,500
So since then I've kind of boned
up on thermionics knowledge.

169
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,800
But that's enough
for the photon stuff.

170
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,130
Now we want to start getting
into ion nuclear interactions

171
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,230
and in today's reading,
it started off--

172
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,060
I think the first
paragraph went something

173
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,550
like, the formula
for stopping power

174
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,780
can be expressed as follows.

175
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,790
Squared times log of--

176
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,660
squared over mean
ionization energy.

177
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,480
And I find this explanation
to be unsatisfactory.

178
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,730
I'm not a fan of the kind
of books that just say,

179
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,540
here's a formula.

180
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,530
For practice, plug
things in and use them.

181
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,440
So instead, I'm
going to skip ahead

182
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,750
to a little bit of
next week's reading

183
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,180
or the [INAUDIBLE] reading
and actually derive it.

184
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,790
So when I just throw
up a formula like this,

185
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,310
it's like how the hell do
you remember that, right?

186
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,370
Well, it's going to make a lot
more sense once we actually

187
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,600
derive it.

188
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,940
So let's set up this problem.

189
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:40,490
You have a charged particle
with charge little z times e.

190
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,230
Little z, we'll
say, is the number

191
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:46,190
of protons in this
nucleus or the charge

192
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,070
on an electron if you
want it, times the unit

193
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,090
charge of an electron.

194
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:55,430
And it's firing at
some other electron

195
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,630
somewhere else in the material.

196
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,580
So the basis of any sort
of ion electron interaction

197
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,993
has to start with the ion being
either struck or repelled--

198
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:06,410
I'm sorry, with
the electron being

199
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,720
struck a repelled by the ion.

200
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,220
And so let's say
that this ion exists.

201
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,920
We'll draw kind
of a unit cylinder

202
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,940
around this physical situation.

203
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,450
And if we draw this
distance right here,

204
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,000
it's one of those
rare cases where

205
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,450
the nomenclature is the same
in pretty much every reading.

206
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,551
There's this distance b, which
we call the impact parameter.

207
00:09:34,045 --> 00:09:35,420
It's kind of a
funny name for it,

208
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,810
but it just means by how
close does your particle

209
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,150
get to that electron
when it undergoes

210
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,280
this single interaction.

211
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,550
And so this particle is moving
quite fast with some speed

212
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:49,468
v towards and then away
from this electron.

213
00:09:49,468 --> 00:09:51,010
And what's going to
happen is there's

214
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,540
going to be some
sort of a Coulomb

215
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:58,660
force between this charged
particle and this electron.

216
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,090
So let's say you're firing
an electron at an electron.

217
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,340
There's going to be
some negative repulsion.

218
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,873
Or if you're firing
an ion at an electron,

219
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:07,540
there might be some
positive attraction.

220
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,570
But at any rate, there's
going to be some deflection.

221
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,000
So let's just say it's a
negatively charged particle.

222
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,960
If we draw its
actual trajectory,

223
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,250
it's actually going to
go off kind of barely

224
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,840
in that direction, right?

225
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,250
Two charges passing
in the night.

226
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,930
They know each other's there.

227
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,920
And they kind of
repel each other.

228
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,710
So what we want to
do is figure out

229
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,080
what is the total
amount of force in the x

230
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,180
and the y direction.

231
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,680
Let's just define our axes
to make sure we're all

232
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,180
on the same page.

233
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,120
And can we resolve that into
a total amount of energy

234
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,060
lost per unit distance?

235
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,460
This quantity right here was for
referred to as stopping power.

236
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,040
Before we launch
into it, does anyone

237
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,420
know why I put a negative
sign on this quantity?

238
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,578
STUDENT: This is
all [INAUDIBLE]..

239
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:00,370
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

240
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:00,913
Yep.

241
00:11:00,913 --> 00:11:02,830
If you're changing the
energy in the particle,

242
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,205
unless it's, let's
say, following

243
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,870
it to some gravitational field,
which we're not covering today

244
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,390
or ever then, it's any
sort of interaction

245
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,730
is going to cause the
particle to lose some energy.

246
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,450
So this quantity right here
is going to be negative,

247
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,610
and so this quantity right
here is going to be positive.

248
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,870
We stick a minus
sign in front of it.

249
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,970
But let's get back
to the basics then.

250
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,900
What is the force between
this charged particle

251
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,148
and the electron from 802?

252
00:11:33,812 --> 00:11:34,945
This Coulomb force.

253
00:11:40,558 --> 00:11:41,600
STUDENT: It's a constant.

254
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,660
PROFESSOR: There is a constant.

255
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,365
Let's just call it k0, because
the reading calls it k0.

256
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:49,290
STUDENT: And then it'd
be z e [INAUDIBLE]..

257
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,410
PROFESSOR: Yes.

258
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,130
Yeah.

259
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,740
So this is like your
q1 and your q1, right?

260
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,153
Your charge 1 and
your charge 2 over?

261
00:11:58,153 --> 00:11:59,070
STUDENT: The distance.

262
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,910
PROFESSOR: The distance squared.

263
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,450
Let's call that the distance
between the two particles.

264
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,570
And so now we can say if
this is the distance away

265
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:11,340
in the x direction,
then we know that r is

266
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,980
root x squared plus b squared.

267
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,400
So we can stick that
in there, and we

268
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:25,490
know that our Coulomb force
would then be this k0 little z

269
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,550
e squared over root--

270
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:34,363
I'm sorry not square root,
just x squared plus b squared.

271
00:12:34,363 --> 00:12:35,780
So like we've done
with everything

272
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,000
so far in the class--

273
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,675
it's kind of dark in the back.

274
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,550
Like we've done with
everything in the class,

275
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,080
let's split this up
into x and y-forces.

276
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,990
So if we assume that
the electron basically

277
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,350
doesn't move, what's
the net amount

278
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,080
of force in the x direction
that this particle is

279
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,690
going to feel when it
goes from minus infinity,

280
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,100
so over here, to plus
infinity like over here.

281
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,943
STUDENT: Zero.

282
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:58,610
PROFESSOR: Zero.

283
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,443
Why do you say that?

284
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:02,900
STUDENT: Because [INAUDIBLE].

285
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,100
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

286
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,830
Whatever force it feels
repelling it from here,

287
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,530
as soon as it hits
this midpoint,

288
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,972
it gets that same
amount of propulsion

289
00:13:11,972 --> 00:13:12,930
in the other direction.

290
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:16,610
So your net force, if you
integrate from minus infinity

291
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:22,340
to infinity, of your x
force as a function of t,

292
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,310
that comes out to zero, which
makes our life a lot easier.

293
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,100
All we have to worry about
is the total integral

294
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,760
of the y force to figure out
how much net deflection do

295
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,770
we get in that direction.

296
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:38,640
This integral is also
better known as a momentum.

297
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,510
Anyone recognize where
with this comes from?

298
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,070
If you take the
integral of a force,

299
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:48,770
it's like the integral of a mass
times an acceleration, which

300
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,230
is like mass times the
integral of acceleration, which

301
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:56,610
is like mv, which is a
momentum this is where some

302
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,700
of our particle wave stuff
is going to get funky,

303
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,250
because we're going to start
throwing in expressions

304
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,835
for particle momentums
in wave equations

305
00:14:04,835 --> 00:14:06,960
when we start to determine,
well, if this is really

306
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,070
an electron.

307
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,335
There's some limitations
on how we can treat it,

308
00:14:10,335 --> 00:14:12,460
where it kind of loses its
character as a particle.

309
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,370
So I just want to warn
you that that's coming up.

310
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:19,950
So now, let's make an
expression for the y force.

311
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,130
If we were to say what is the
y momentum imparted, which

312
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:27,645
is an integral of the y
component of the force dt,

313
00:14:27,645 --> 00:14:29,520
we already have the
expression for the force,

314
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,630
like you guys derived.

315
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:36,930
K0 time as little
ze times e over r

316
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:42,225
squared, which is x
squared plus b squared.

317
00:14:42,225 --> 00:14:44,100
And then how do we get
the y component of it?

318
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,360
Well, we've got to
define an angle.

319
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,023
That's our angle theta.

320
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:55,565
What's the y component
of that force?

321
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,920
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

322
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,620
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's just
times cosine theta dt.

323
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,690
What's the expression
for cosine theta

324
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,590
in this physical situation?

325
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,500
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

326
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,230
PROFESSOR: Close.

327
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,120
b over r.

328
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,220
And in this case, r is root
x squared plus b squared.

329
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,770
And the last thing we want is
because we have things in terms

330
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,850
of x and b, b's a
constant, x is a variable,

331
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,930
t's kind of the wrong variable.

332
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,500
So we can do a
variable change and say

333
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,380
this is equivalent to the
velocity of the particle over--

334
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:47,500
I'm sorry-- to dx over v. We're
just using this whole like

335
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,810
velocity equals, what is
it, distance times time,

336
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,234
so our whole, what is it--

337
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:57,430
yeah.

338
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,890
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

339
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,660
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

340
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,590
Distance equals velocity times.

341
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,840
Thinks, [INAUDIBLE].

342
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,300
OK, anyway.

343
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,977
So luckily, I had
the expression right

344
00:16:08,977 --> 00:16:10,060
and the explanation wrong.

345
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,602
So thank you.

346
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,470
Was that Luke or Jared's voice?

347
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,970
Awesome.

348
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:13,720
OK.

349
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,850
So let's put this
whole expression in,

350
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,438
keep that little
embarrassment behind us.

351
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:20,980
We have the integral
from negative to

352
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:28,670
plus infinity of k0
little z e squared times b

353
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,067
over x squared plus
b squared times

354
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:33,150
the square root of itself.

355
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:38,440
So let's just say x squared
plus b squared to the 3/2,

356
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,930
and there's a v
on the bottom dx.

357
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,030
This is finally valuable.

358
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,568
So we're getting closer.

359
00:16:45,568 --> 00:16:47,360
Let's take all the
constants and shove them

360
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,070
outside the integral.

361
00:16:49,070 --> 00:17:00,090
So we have a k0 z squared eV
over b squared b over velocity

362
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:07,910
times the integral of
just 1 over x squared

363
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:13,310
plus b squared to the 3/2 dx.

364
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,119
Not remembering the formula off
the top of my head, I-- yeah?

365
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,442
STUDENT: So we can treat
the velocity as a constant

366
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:20,329
even though it's losing energy.

367
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:22,940
PROFESSOR: Yes, that's--
well, we'll call it a crude

368
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,537
derivation.

369
00:17:23,537 --> 00:17:25,579
But if we're assuming that
the electron basically

370
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:28,099
doesn't change position,
that it changes so little,

371
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,557
then we're going to assume that
also the velocity basically

372
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:32,390
doesn't change,
that one collision

373
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:36,350
for a high enough velocity
doesn't lose that much energy.

374
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,708
So that's what we're
going with for now.

375
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,250
And we'll actually
be able to compare

376
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,500
this kind of crude
derivation to one

377
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,378
done from quantum mechanics,
and they look pretty similar.

378
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:47,420
There's like an extra
factor of two or something.

379
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,000
But as I showed you guys in
preparing for the test, when

380
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,330
I said 9 equals about
10, it therefore

381
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,240
follows that 1 equals
about 2, and as long

382
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,640
as we get the constants and
orders of magnitude right,

383
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,765
we're going to gain the
physical intuition for what

384
00:18:00,765 --> 00:18:01,640
we're looking at.

385
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,190
I'll leave it up there.

386
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,280
Anyway, evaluated this integral,
and it came out to something

387
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,710
like 2 over b squared.

388
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:20,120
So this just comes out to k0
ze squared b with a 2 over 2 vb

389
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,530
squared.

390
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:25,200
Cancel the b's.

391
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,010
I don't know where
that 2 came from.

392
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:27,510
Whatever.

393
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,280
Yeah, that's what we
have for the stopping

394
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,270
power for this sort of one
particle hitting one electron.

395
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:41,110
Now, we have-- well, sorry,
that's the momentum equation.

396
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,602
But we're interested in
the change in energy.

397
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:45,310
So what's that equation
we've used before

398
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,210
to go from momentum to energy?

399
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,820
Our kinetic energy t.

400
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,560
STUDENT: Square root
of q [INAUDIBLE]..

401
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,500
PROFESSOR: Other way around.

402
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:04,950
So let's do it that way,
right, so p equals root 2 mT.

403
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,680
OK, so square both sides.

404
00:19:09,272 --> 00:19:09,980
Yeah, you got it.

405
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:20,410
And we have our energy
T is p squared over 2m.

406
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:26,080
So let's take this small
little mess, stick it in here,

407
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:32,710
and then we end up with 4k0
squared little z squared e

408
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:41,830
to the fourth over
2mv squared b.

409
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,060
Cool.

410
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,390
And so this gives us the little
differential energy change

411
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,560
from one electron collision.

412
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,110
Yeah?

413
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,128
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

414
00:19:50,128 --> 00:19:52,170
PROFESSOR: I think we
cancel one of those, right?

415
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,480
STUDENT: Yeah, but then
when you square [INAUDIBLE]..

416
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,250
PROFESSOR: Oh
yeah, you're right.

417
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,600
Thank you.

418
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,680
Comes back.

419
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,790
b squared b squared.

420
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,540
Yep, you're right.

421
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,860
Thank you.

422
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,680
So now we've only accounted
for the ion hitting

423
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,580
a single electron as it moves
through this hollow cylinder

424
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,180
of whatever medium
it's going through.

425
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,380
So this is when we can kind of
take things back from abstract

426
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,370
to reality and say,
all right, it's moving

427
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,720
through some actual material.

428
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,720
And we have to describe
its electron density

429
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,880
in this cylindrical shell.

430
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,300
So the electron density in the
cylindrical shell depends on--

431
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,820
well, the number
density of the material

432
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:33,070
itself, just how many atoms
are there times big Z,

433
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,930
the number of protons
in that nucleus

434
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:38,530
and therefore the number of
electrons in each nucleus,

435
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,885
and the volume of the
cylindrical shell.

436
00:20:40,885 --> 00:20:42,510
So what's the expression
for the volume

437
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,552
of the cylindrical shell?

438
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,120
In differential form?

439
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,790
Yeah, I started hearing?

440
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,540
I heard a 2.

441
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,130
That's correct.

442
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:52,630
Keep going.

443
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,510
Well, 2 pi b gives
us the circumference

444
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:05,600
of the circle on the
outside of the cylinder.

445
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,850
And if we add a little db there,
some differential thickness

446
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:14,680
element, and we add on a
little dx for some differential

447
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,920
distance down the
cylinder, we end up

448
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:27,290
with 2 pi b dv dx,
multiplied by this stuff.

449
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:32,490
And we get some differential
change in energy scales like--

450
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:37,700
let's say there is
a 4 and a 2 there.

451
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,620
So we end up with 4.

452
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,580
That's not a 4.

453
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:48,130
pi k0 squared, little
z squared, big Z

454
00:21:48,130 --> 00:22:01,690
e to the fourth b dv dx
over mv squared b squared.

455
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,020
Now those other b's cancel.

456
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,400
We can divide everything by dx.

457
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,250
And we've already almost got
our stopping power expression.

458
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,837
We're getting pretty close.

459
00:22:12,837 --> 00:22:14,670
Anyone see some
similarities between the one

460
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:19,220
I just threw out of my head
and what we've got so far?

461
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,220
We've almost got
the makings of it.

462
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,020
So now if we want to
account for the fact

463
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,360
that our charged
particle is probably not

464
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,460
shooting through the center
of a perfect hollow cylinder,

465
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,270
but we're just firing it
into like actual matter,

466
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:34,340
we have to account for
every possible impact

467
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,200
parameter in every
possible cylindrical shell

468
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,360
that it would be moving through.

469
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:44,638
So in this case, we
can integrate this.

470
00:22:44,638 --> 00:22:46,180
We've already got
our db right there.

471
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,700
That's our integrating variable.

472
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,030
And now here's where things
get a little tricksy.

473
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:57,520
Can we actually integrate this
from an impact parameter of 0?

474
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,972
And this is not an
easy question actually.

475
00:23:03,972 --> 00:23:04,930
What do you guys think?

476
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:09,100
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

477
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,660
PROFESSOR: So Luke says no, why?

478
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,591
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

479
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,970
PROFESSOR: We actually
have an over b.

480
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:26,950
We have a v squared, but that's
not our integrating variable.

481
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,010
Yeah, so we have like
a 1 over b looking--

482
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,116
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

483
00:23:31,116 --> 00:23:32,324
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's fine.

484
00:23:32,324 --> 00:23:34,930
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

485
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,957
PROFESSOR: That's true.

486
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,790
There's another more
physical reason though.

487
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,960
But you're right mathematically.

488
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,950
Can you know precisely the
location of an electron ever?

489
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,450
Now I see a lot of
people saying no.

490
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,100
Why do you say that?

491
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,340
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

492
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,340
PROFESSOR: That's right.

493
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,980
There's this thing-- the De
Broglie uncertainty principle.

494
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,815
It's kind of the punchline of a
lot of quantum mechanics jokes.

495
00:24:05,815 --> 00:24:07,690
You never know where
something is going to be

496
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,720
or where it's going.

497
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,200
We used to say this about
some of the older professors

498
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,580
in this department.

499
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,320
If you call them and
say, I'm on my way,

500
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,778
I'm getting there
as fast as I can,

501
00:24:15,778 --> 00:24:17,325
they could be
anywhere in the world.

502
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:19,450
And if they say, don't
worry, I'm three miles away.

503
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,040
You don't know how long it's
going to take them to get here.

504
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,540
Same thing with me
and getting here.

505
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,420
Although I was on
MIT standard time,

506
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,980
which means five minutes late.

507
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,240
Not bad.

508
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,660
So in this case, we have
to ascribe the electron

509
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,398
some sort of a wavelength.

510
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:35,440
So in this case, we can't
just treat the electron

511
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,320
like a particle whose
position we know.

512
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,240
We're going to go with
our original equation

513
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,760
for a photon energy, which
looks like hc over lambda.

514
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,520
Rearrange that so that we'll
have some lambda wavelength

515
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:54,810
equals hc over E.

516
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:55,310
I'm sorry.

517
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,320
This is a momentum thing,
not an energy thing.

518
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,580
And what's the momentum
of the electron?

519
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,740
From the classical definition?

520
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,200
It's just mass times
velocity, right?

521
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,260
So we'll just stick in
the mass of the electron

522
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,510
times the velocity right there.

523
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:26,120
And this wavelength right
here, the De Broglie wavelength

524
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,210
of the electron is as close
as we can specify that impact

525
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,290
parameter.

526
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:34,430
And it turns out to be pretty
significant, like on the order

527
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,170
of 0.1 to 0.2 angstroms.

528
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:40,010
You can't tell where an electron
is going to be finer than that.

529
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,710
So we're going to
have this b minimum.

530
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:48,750
I'll just write that in
there and some b maximum,

531
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:54,157
where are b minimum is
the same as our De Broglie

532
00:25:54,157 --> 00:25:55,740
wavelength of the
electron, because we

533
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,830
can't define its position
any better than that,

534
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:03,960
which is just Planck's constant
over its mass times velocity.

535
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,620
For b max, it comes
out to something

536
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:15,780
like hv over this
quantity, I bar

537
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,426
what's called the mean
ionization potential.

538
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,790
What this quantity
physically represents

539
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:34,180
is that if your impact
parameter is too large,

540
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,640
then the electron will--
or the charged particle

541
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,150
will feel so little force,
that it won't eject an electron

542
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,100
and won't really be deflected.

543
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,460
And the farthest away
it can be corresponds

544
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,910
to the minimum amount of energy
to create an average ionization

545
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,670
in the material.

546
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:55,710
And this mean ionization
potential scales

547
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:58,770
with something like
this constant k times

548
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:05,670
z, where k is on the
order of like 30 to 35--

549
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,530
think it's like eV.

550
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:13,700
But remarkably tight constant,
so picking a mean value

551
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,240
like that is no problem.

552
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,060
And there we have
our b min and b max.

553
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:22,550
Those are our limits
of integration.

554
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:26,610
I think I planned this just
to fill up the boards today.

555
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,490
So let's write out the
final integral that we have

556
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,220
and see what we get.

557
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,400
So we have our
stopping power, should

558
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:48,200
be integral from b min h over mv
to b max jv over I bar of 4 pi

559
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:54,860
k0 squared little z squared
big Ze to the fourth over mv

560
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,240
squared b db.

561
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,910
And like I think it
was Sarah that you

562
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,953
mentioned that we'd have a log.

563
00:28:02,953 --> 00:28:04,120
I forget who's mentioned it.

564
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,620
Sorry.

565
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,548
That was Luke, OK?

566
00:28:05,548 --> 00:28:06,090
You're right.

567
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,715
So it ends up just
being a natural log.

568
00:28:07,715 --> 00:28:10,980
It's like all this junk
on the outside times

569
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,810
the integral of 1 over b.

570
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,960
So this just comes
out to 4 pi k0

571
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:22,570
squared little z squared
big Ze to the fourth over mv

572
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:32,570
square times the natural
log of dv max over b min.

573
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,200
The h's cancel.

574
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,550
We get a v squared.

575
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,470
And so all this
stuff inside just

576
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:50,630
becomes the natural log of mv
squared over mean ionization

577
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,060
potential.

578
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,190
And we've arrived basically
at the same equation

579
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,530
that we have over
there, that I took care

580
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,940
to memorize on the plane.

581
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,490
So great that we've gotten
here through the math.

582
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,195
Let's actually see
what this means,

583
00:29:04,195 --> 00:29:06,570
and we're going to go into
some of the limits of validity

584
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:10,050
like Luke was saying, where you
can't have a natural log of 0.

585
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:14,520
So the stopping power formula
isn't quite going to work at 0.

586
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,390
Nor will it work at
super low energies.

587
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:23,000
So if you want to write what
this should be proportional to.

588
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,500
I kind of see some constants
here that we don't really care.

589
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,060
They don't vary at all.

590
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:30,480
But this looks kind of
like a kinetic energy term,

591
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,920
doesn't it?

592
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,190
Like kinetic energy terms.

593
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:38,290
So it's kind of proportional
to this function 1 over t

594
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,958
times the natural log of t.

595
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:42,500
When you get rid of
all the constants

596
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,600
and just express it in
terms of the variables,

597
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,420
it looks a whole lot simpler.

598
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,900
And so let's see what
this would look like if we

599
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,780
started to graph it out.

600
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,080
And this is pretty universal
for any charged particle

601
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,400
stopping power.

602
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,340
So if this was the
kinetic energy t,

603
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:07,690
and this was our stopping power,
we've got this 1 over T term

604
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,980
that's going to look
something like this.

605
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,430
And we have this natural
log of T term, which

606
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,930
is going to look something like
this that actually goes down

607
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,448
to infinity.

608
00:30:19,448 --> 00:30:20,990
So like Luke was
saying, if these two

609
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,615
are multiplied by
each other, we're not

610
00:30:22,615 --> 00:30:25,370
going to have negative infinity
as a stopping power, which

611
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:28,550
would physically mean that once
the particle hit zero energy,

612
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,990
it speeds up to
infinite speed, and that

613
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,850
doesn't make any sense.

614
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,510
But we can start to draw
what the curve would

615
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:38,550
look like with this
general envelope.

616
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:41,970
And so at low energies, the
stopping power kind of scales

617
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,840
like 1 over e.

618
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,490
Let's now start
drawing another graph

619
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,620
with a little more
physical intuition,

620
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,560
the range of the particle.

621
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,060
So while stopping power might
be kind of a new quantity that

622
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,730
represents the differential
amount of energy lost

623
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,130
as a function of distance--
that's kind of a mouthful--

624
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:03,590
the range is pretty simple,
just how far it goes.

625
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:06,825
So to get the range
from the stopping power,

626
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:08,200
you can integrate--
let's say you

627
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,460
fire a particle into a bunch
of matter at some energy T.

628
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,370
So you start off an energy
T, and you want to see

629
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:19,060
how far it gets at distance 0.

630
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:24,890
Well, you can just
integrate the stopping power

631
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,840
as a function of T,
or you can switch

632
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,490
your limits of integration.

633
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,850
Let's see.

634
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:32,390
I'm sorry.

635
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,515
I'm not going to switch
those limits of integration

636
00:31:34,515 --> 00:31:44,200
yet, which is like saying
from 0 to T of dt dx dt, which

637
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:55,182
is like saying from 0 to T
of dt dx to the minus 1 dx.

638
00:31:55,182 --> 00:31:57,107
Much simpler expression.

639
00:31:57,107 --> 00:31:58,940
And when you forget all
the crazy constants,

640
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:02,870
and you just take
this kind of form

641
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:07,033
as the variable part of the
expression for stopping power,

642
00:32:07,033 --> 00:32:08,450
unless your energy
is really high,

643
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:12,470
and this natural log counts at
all, your range kind of scales

644
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:16,880
like the integral
of just 1 over T.

645
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,100
I'm sorry, that to
the minus 1, which

646
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:24,870
is like the integral of T,
which is like T squared, which

647
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:28,590
means that this are pretty
interesting intuitive result,

648
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,230
that the range of the
particle increases

649
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,898
with the square of its energy.

650
00:32:32,898 --> 00:32:34,440
So this gives you
a good hint to say,

651
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,960
if I increase the particle
by a certain amount,

652
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,010
I'll increase the range by the
square root of that increase.

653
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,290
So anyway let's start
drawing this range

654
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,780
curve as a function of x.

655
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,390
What this says right here is
that if we start our particle

656
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:54,400
at some high energy, and we're
firing into the material,

657
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,650
and it's losing
energy as it goes,

658
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:00,010
and we track this value
of the stopping power

659
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:05,660
to figure out how far it's going
to go, change that in a second,

660
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,150
for the first little while
as this particle loses

661
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,010
more and more energy,
its stopping power

662
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:13,910
stays mostly constant, and it
loses a pretty constant amount

663
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:17,000
of energy as a function of time.

664
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,970
As its energy gets
lower and lower,

665
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:23,420
it loses more and more as
a function of position.

666
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:26,300
What this actually means is
that as the velocity goes down

667
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,700
or as the particle's
energy goes down,

668
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,170
it spends more time in the
vicinity of the electron

669
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,802
and gets deflected more.

670
00:33:33,802 --> 00:33:35,510
It's just that kind
of a simple argument.

671
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,270
Like the more time it
spends near this electron,

672
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:40,660
the more it feels the push.

673
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,500
And so it will lose
more and more energy

674
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,490
as its energy gets lower and
lower until you hit the point

675
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:50,297
where this curve breaks down.

676
00:33:50,297 --> 00:33:51,630
Where do you guys think that is?

677
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,220
Even mathematically speaking.

678
00:34:01,978 --> 00:34:04,270
Well, what happens if your
natural log term is negative

679
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,495
here?

680
00:34:05,495 --> 00:34:07,120
Then you get a negative
stopping power,

681
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,850
which would be like the
particle picks up energy.

682
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:13,489
That's not quite
physical at all.

683
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:16,510
So in reality, we know
that at some point

684
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:20,739
it's going to taper off,
and the stopping power at 0

685
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:23,310
should be 0.

686
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:28,880
This maximum right here
occurs around 500 times

687
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,997
the mean ionization potential,
which is a pretty low energy,

688
00:34:31,997 --> 00:34:34,580
but what this actually says is
that when the particle's moving

689
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,000
really slow, it's moving so
slow that once in a while,

690
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,219
it will capture one
of those electrons,

691
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:44,690
like if you fire in a proton or
a positively charged heavy ion,

692
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,090
if it's moving so slow
that it can feel the pull,

693
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,580
it will just
partially neutralize.

694
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:53,929
And that becomes the next
mechanism of energy loss.

695
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:56,150
And so if we keep following
this curve, once we

696
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,850
hit some sort of a
maximum, then it's

697
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:01,430
going to lose less and
less and less energy,

698
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:05,120
do less and less damage, and
you end up with the same curve,

699
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,140
this kind of brag peak
curve that we did together

700
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,330
when we used the SRIM code.

701
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:15,050
Did I go through the stopping
range of ions in matter

702
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:15,670
with you guys?

703
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,550
Did I show you
this on the screen?

704
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,120
Remember the curve of the--

705
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,310
let's say damage events
per distance or number

706
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:25,390
of implanted ions as a
function of distance.

707
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:29,270
You end up with the
exact same thing.

708
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:32,770
That's what the SR stands
for in SRIM is stopping,

709
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,270
what is it, stopping power and
range or something like that.

710
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,230
Something range of
ions and matter.

711
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,510
Is it the stopping power and
range of ions and matter?

712
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:45,750
I don't know, but all SRIM
is a gigantic stopping power

713
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,510
database and a big
Monte Carlo engine.

714
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:51,270
So it takes an equation
just like this one or--

715
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,400
yeah, just like
this one, that one,

716
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,025
whichever one you want
and decides, well,

717
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:01,650
how often is the
particle going to lose

718
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:06,070
how much energy depending
on where it happens to be?

719
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:08,910
And that's all there is to it.

720
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,430
This point here, we
would call the range

721
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:14,040
or like the average range
at which-- well, that's

722
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,820
not quite right.

723
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:19,840
There'd be some average
range around here

724
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,670
where the particles
actually stop,

725
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,620
when their energy goes to zero.

726
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,380
And in reality, because
every one of these processes

727
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,020
is random in nature,
the impact parameter

728
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,580
is going to be kind of random.

729
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,250
Not every particle will
stop at the same place,

730
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,710
because all the electrons are
moving around in the atoms.

731
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:40,980
So there's going to be some
sort of a range of ranges, which

732
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:46,430
we call straggling,
which is to say

733
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:49,310
that not all of the particles
end up at the exact same range,

734
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:53,250
but they end up pretty close.

735
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,000
I think I want to pause
here for a seconds

736
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,110
and see if there's any
questions from this four board

737
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,330
derivation or any
intuition questions

738
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,110
that you guys might have.

739
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,040
Yeah.

740
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,620
STUDENT: You didn't initially
have the negative d2 over dx.

741
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,650
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah,
where'd that go?

742
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,790
Let's trace this through.

743
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,415
STUDENT: What happened
to the negative?

744
00:37:09,415 --> 00:37:11,350
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

745
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,335
STUDENT: But we didn't
actually derive it.

746
00:37:15,335 --> 00:37:16,460
PROFESSOR: Yeah, let's see.

747
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,230
So the change in
energy should have been

748
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,600
a negative change in energy.

749
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,120
So if we-- it went
missing there.

750
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,150
So there we go.

751
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:35,270
That's the only other place
that seems to be missing.

752
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:37,106
OK, great.

753
00:37:37,106 --> 00:37:38,445
Cool.

754
00:37:38,445 --> 00:37:40,820
Then if you want to start
looking at the number of damage

755
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:45,140
events that this
particle will incur,

756
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,090
we'll call this the
number of ion pairs, which

757
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:49,400
might look suspiciously
familiar if you guys remember

758
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,200
the Chadwick paper,
he was talking

759
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,410
about this proton of this
energy should make this many ion

760
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,970
pairs at this distance.

761
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,470
Now you guys actually
have the tools

762
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:00,110
to find out what that
number should be,

763
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:09,310
because it's going to be 1
over some ion pair energy,

764
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:16,150
usually around 30 to 35 eV,
depending on the material times

765
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:21,830
dt vx, which is to say when
the stopping power is higher,

766
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,930
you're going to have
more ion pairs produced

767
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,850
as a function of distance.

768
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:28,250
So the real label
for this y-axis

769
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:36,630
here should be like ion pairs
or damage or defects or anything

770
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:39,090
like that that refers to the
same kind of thing as damages

771
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:42,360
to the material, either
by ionization or even

772
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,383
by similar nuclear processes.

773
00:38:46,383 --> 00:38:48,050
And so that's what
results in those SRIM

774
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:50,490
curves that we showed from
before, where you have,

775
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:53,550
let's say, a bunch of protons
entering a material here

776
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,290
at some high energy.

777
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:58,100
They don't lose very much
energy when they go in,

778
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,440
but as soon as they get
to a low enough energy

779
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,840
where they're stopping
power reaches the maximum,

780
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,590
they dump most of
their energy in there.

781
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:09,620
And this is the basis behind
proton cancer therapy, which

782
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:13,350
I mentioned to you guys in the
first or second day of class.

783
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:16,560
Now that we know both
exponential attenuation

784
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,250
and stopping power, we
can explain theoretically

785
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,500
why proton therapy is a
more effective treatment.

786
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:28,930
So let's say this is the
person that contains a tumor.

787
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,470
Say it's right there.

788
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:35,670
And you have a choice
between firing in an X-ray

789
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:39,430
or firing in a proton.

790
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,920
What is the dose to this
person, not just to the tumor,

791
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,760
but through the whole person
going to look like for X-rays?

792
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,650
Get another board.

793
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,630
So if we look at the number
of ion pairs, and let's

794
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:58,300
say this is the
thickness of the person,

795
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:03,230
and the tumor is in this range.

796
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:08,830
And if you send in
your X-rays, or you

797
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:12,130
send in your protons,
what is the number of ion

798
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:14,980
pairs produced from X-ray
or from proton going

799
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,488
to look like in either case?

800
00:40:16,488 --> 00:40:18,280
So first of all, who
wants do the X-ray one

801
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,405
or tell me what it will be?

802
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:25,540
You guys-- yeah, Luke?

803
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,970
STUDENT: Would it
be pretty flat?

804
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,720
PROFESSOR: It'll be
fairly flat, but there

805
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,020
would be some decay to it.

806
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:33,880
So let's say we defined some
initial intensity, X-rays just

807
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,890
get attenuated exponentially.

808
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:39,790
So you're going to do a whole
lot of damage to the person

809
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:42,700
before the X-rays
reach the tumor, which

810
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,280
is why when you
do X-ray therapy,

811
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,880
you have to send in x-rays from
a bunch of different locations

812
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,080
so that the tumor
gives out the most,

813
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,020
and the rest of the
person in any location

814
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,780
doesn't get that much dose.

815
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,730
For proton therapy,
it's quite different.

816
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,673
It looks just like this.

817
00:40:59,673 --> 00:41:01,840
So you might do a little
bit of damage as you go in,

818
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:06,787
and you tune the energy
of those protons,

819
00:41:06,787 --> 00:41:08,620
so that they do all the
damage in the tumor,

820
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:11,548
and then they stop in the
tumor or just beyond it,

821
00:41:11,548 --> 00:41:13,090
so that they don't
do any more damage

822
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:16,310
to the rest of the person, and
they do very little going in.

823
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,190
And so that's why
proton therapy centers

824
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,930
are popping up
all over the world

825
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:21,950
because it's a more
effective treatment.

826
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:27,512
It's also more expensive because
you need a proton accelerator

827
00:41:27,512 --> 00:41:28,970
so then, here's a
question for you.

828
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:33,390
This is something they
actually do in the lab.

829
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,820
Say, here's your human.

830
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,900
There's your tumor.

831
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:44,110
There is your proton
gun at a fixed 250 MeV,

832
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,610
firing protons out.

833
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,960
How do you change the
range of those protons

834
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,210
without changing their energy?

835
00:41:52,965 --> 00:41:54,590
STUDENT: The distance
it has to travel?

836
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,110
PROFESSOR: Is what?

837
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,900
STUDENT: The distance it
has to travel the other way.

838
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,420
PROFESSOR: The distance it
has to travel specifically?

839
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,790
I mean, if they travel in a
vacuum, do they lose energy?

840
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:03,290
No.

841
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,420
So what can you do?

842
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:07,545
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

843
00:42:07,835 --> 00:42:09,210
PROFESSOR: You
could deflect them

844
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,620
and change their direction.

845
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:14,580
But as we'll get into on
Tuesday, if you deflect them,

846
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,180
they're going to
emit lots of X-rays

847
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,430
in the form of Bremmstrahlung.

848
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:20,040
So that's probably not
what we want to do.

849
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,630
You can put stuff--

850
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:24,690
and I can't be any more
specific than that--

851
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,720
in between the proton
beam and the patient,

852
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,950
because if the stopping power
for 250 MeV protons and 50 MeV

853
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,320
protons basically
doesn't change,

854
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,150
then you just put
things in the way.

855
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,595
So let's say this is the
thickness of the person.

856
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:46,650
You just put some
tissue equivalent stuff,

857
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:50,100
or what they'll call a phantom,
so some tissue equivalent gel

858
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,220
or water or some other
stuff to lower the proton

859
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,220
energy without deflecting
the beam that much.

860
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,860
So as you guys saw in
the SRIM simulation,

861
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:02,430
if you track the 3D
positions of these protons

862
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:05,880
as they enter into the material,
they all go pretty straight,

863
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,550
and then they start
getting funny.

864
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,550
Computer can fly the
ions faster than I can.

865
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,650
But no matter what
it goes through here,

866
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:18,220
while the protons
have high energy,

867
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,890
they don't get
deflected much, they

868
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,600
don't lose that much energy.

869
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,620
And you can very finely tune
the amount of stuff in the way.

870
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:29,010
This would be the stuff section
before entering the person.

871
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,330
So this is why it's so useful.

872
00:43:35,962 --> 00:43:37,420
So let me check
the time, because I

873
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,000
haven't checked at all.

874
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,060
The clock's broken.

875
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,420
Oh, we have like 10 minutes.

876
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,060
So now is a good time
to stop for questions

877
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,940
and see if you guys have any
questions from the derivation

878
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:52,030
or the sort of physical meaning
of stopping power and matter.

879
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:56,300
Yeah.

880
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,540
STUDENT: What was the
nz sort of [INAUDIBLE]??

881
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:11,182
PROFESSOR: Yes, the nz, n is
the number density of atoms.

882
00:44:11,182 --> 00:44:13,640
So if you're traveling through
some actual block of matter,

883
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,500
it depends how many
atoms are in the way.

884
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:21,830
So if the total stopping power
decreases with decreasing

885
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:24,410
density, like if you're
going through tungsten,

886
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,410
but it happens to be a tungsten
gas, that tungsten gas will not

887
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:30,470
have nearly as much stopping
power as tungsten metal,

888
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:32,680
because there's just more
tungsten than the weight.

889
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,460
Or less, I'm sorry.

890
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:39,890
And the z right here
is the charge per atom,

891
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:42,500
to say if you're firing
electrons into something,

892
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,947
the strength of
the Coulomb force

893
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:46,280
that they'll feel, or let's
say, the number of electrons

894
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,030
that they can smack into is the
same with the number of protons

895
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:54,110
in that nucleus if we're
not using ionized materials.

896
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:56,210
And we're typically
not firing anything

897
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:57,290
into ionized materials.

898
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:00,710
It's just normal neutral matter.

899
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,352
Does that make more sense?

900
00:45:02,352 --> 00:45:03,570
Cool.

901
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:04,810
Yeah, Luke.

902
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:07,618
STUDENT: Where did that n go?

903
00:45:07,618 --> 00:45:09,160
PROFESSOR: It should
have been there.

904
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,320
Thank you.

905
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,755
pi n.

906
00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:14,880
Should absolutely be there.

907
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,290
Anything else?

908
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:21,910
Yeah, Dan.

909
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:22,830
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

910
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:23,756
PROFESSOR: OK.

911
00:45:23,756 --> 00:45:25,390
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

912
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,680
PROFESSOR: The
charge per atom is

913
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,130
big Z. The charge
on the particle

914
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:35,320
is little z, because both
of them actually matter.

915
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,950
So little z tells
you the strength

916
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:41,220
of the interaction between the
particle and each electron.

917
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:44,730
Big Z tells you how many
electrons are there per atom.

918
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:46,720
Big N tells you how many
atoms are in the way.

919
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,720
And in that way, you have
a complete description

920
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,530
of the material.

921
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:53,170
Curious that the mass
of the charged particle

922
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:56,290
is absent from this formula.

923
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:58,390
Isn't it?

924
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:59,220
Yeah.

925
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,280
The mass doesn't matter.

926
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,190
You will certainly
change the momentum of,

927
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:06,320
let's say, a charged
particle less.

928
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:10,250
But in the end, it's just
non-contact Coulomb forces

929
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:12,230
that determine the
energy transfer

930
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:14,810
between the electrons in there
and the charged particles

931
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:17,730
slowing down in the medium.

932
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:21,680
So that is a curious thing to
look at, but it is intentional.

933
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,110
For the case of this ionization
or electronic stopping power,

934
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:30,250
the mass does not enter into
it at least in this formula.

935
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:33,220
There is another version
derived that's in your reading

936
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:35,380
that they just kind of
plop it in front of you

937
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:37,720
that's got the mass somewhere
in the natural long term

938
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,095
somewhere where
it really doesn't

939
00:46:39,095 --> 00:46:41,845
change much at all, except
for really high energies.

940
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,160
So if you want to
think about, well,

941
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,130
what do I want you
to know, I would

942
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:52,340
want you to be able to go
through this derivation again,

943
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:55,670
so that I can know you can
go from a intuitive example

944
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:58,520
to an actual equation
you can use, graph

945
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,010
what that equation
should look like and talk

946
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:05,210
about where it really matters
and where it breaks down.

947
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:08,750
Like mathematically speaking,
if this natural long term

948
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:12,110
is negative, you're not going to
have a negative stopping power.

949
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:15,560
Something else has got to
occur, and what's happening here

950
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,640
is neutralization.

951
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:25,720
And that's why the stopping
power curve diverges

952
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,470
for really low energies,
because sometimes

953
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,428
electrons get captured.

954
00:47:31,817 --> 00:47:33,400
Any other questions
on stopping power?

955
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:39,320
Cool.

956
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,220
This is a good place
to stop for now.
