8
00:00:21,872 --> 00:00:24,080
MICHAEL SHORT: So I'd like
to do a quick two or three

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,872
minute review of the
stuff we did last time

10
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:27,578
to get you back
into where we were.

11
00:00:27,578 --> 00:00:29,120
We were talking
about different types

12
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,920
of technologies that
use the stuff you'll

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,710
be learning in 22.01.

14
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,590
Everything ranging from nuclear
reactors for producing power,

15
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,130
and the Cherenkov radiation
that tells you-- well,

16
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,990
that the beta particles
are moving faster

17
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,610
than the speed of
light in water.

18
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:46,790
It's a neat thing, too.

19
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,280
I've actually been
to this reactor

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,200
at Idaho, to the
spent fuel pool.

21
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,740
Even the spent fuel, once
it comes out of the reactor,

22
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,270
is still giving
off betas and still

23
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,890
giving off Cherenkov radiation.

24
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,140
And you can tell how long
it's been out of the reactor

25
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,220
by how dim the glow gets,
which is pretty cool.

26
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,720
So you can tell how old a fuel
assembly is by the blue glow.

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,737
So remember, I told you
guys, if someone says,

28
00:01:06,737 --> 00:01:08,320
oh, you're nuclear,
do you glow green?

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,300
You can be like, no, it's blue.

30
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,670
That's the right way of things.

31
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,860
We talked about
fusion energy and got

32
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,780
into some of the nuclear
reactions involved

33
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,590
in fusion energy.

34
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,320
And I'll be teaching you
more about these today.

35
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,000
Why fission and
fusion work, it all

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,370
has to do with the
stability and binding

37
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,750
energy of the nuclei involved.

38
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,820
And that'll be the
main topic for today,

39
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:32,440
is excess mass, binding
energy, nuclear stability.

40
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,720
We looked at medical
uses of radiation,

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,420
from implanting
radioactive seeds called

42
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,800
brachytherapy seeds in certain
places to destroy tumors,

43
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:47,500
to imaging, to X-ray therapy,
to proton therapy using

44
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,460
accelerators, or cyclotrons,
to accelerate protons and send

45
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,920
them into people.

46
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,210
If you remember, last
time we ran the SRIM code

47
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,460
of the stopping range
of ions and matter,

48
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,050
and actually showed
that protons all

49
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,660
stop at a certain
distance in tissue,

50
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:06,050
depending on their energy and
what you're sending them into.

51
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,056
Let's see-- we talked
about brachytherapy.

52
00:02:09,056 --> 00:02:10,639
We talked about
radiotracers, and this

53
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,014
is going to be one of the
other main topics for today, is

54
00:02:13,014 --> 00:02:15,890
these decay diagrams,
and figuring out not only

55
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,650
what products are made,
but what energy levels do

56
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,900
the nuclei have, and
how do you calculate

57
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,550
the energy of the
radioactive decay

58
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,150
products and the recoil
nuclei, which do take away

59
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,730
some of the energy.

60
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,310
We talked about one
way to get rich.

61
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,060
If you guys can figure
out one of the ways

62
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,640
to solve this moly-99 shortage.

63
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,440
Right now, it's mostly
made in reactors.

64
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,390
The future has got
to be accelerators

65
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,450
or some sort of
switchable device

66
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,680
where you don't need
to construct a reactor

67
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,170
to make these medical isotopes
for imaging, and tracers,

68
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,273
and such.

69
00:02:46,273 --> 00:02:47,690
And finally, we
got all the way up

70
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,980
to space applications,
shielding, crazy, different

71
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,770
types of shielding, like
electromagnetic shielding,

72
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,920
to protect from high
energy protons, all the way

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,400
to radiothermal generators,
which use alpha decay

74
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,920
to produce a constant
amount of energy

75
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,210
on the order of one to 200
watts for like 100 years.

76
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,943
And finally, to a
different configuration

77
00:03:09,943 --> 00:03:11,360
of nuclear reactors,
where you can

78
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,960
design them to produce thrust,
not necessarily electricity.

79
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,558
And that's where we
stopped on Friday.

80
00:03:18,558 --> 00:03:20,600
So let's move on to one
of the things I'd alluded

81
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,780
to earlier, which is
semiconductor processing.

82
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,450
This is actually a diagram
from the MIT reactor,

83
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,520
because we have
this beam port here.

84
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,260
Has anyone got to
see the silicon beam

85
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,760
port at the MIT reactor?

86
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,135
Oh, seven, eight--
OK, about half of you.

87
00:03:35,135 --> 00:03:36,760
For those who haven't,
who here has not

88
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,520
had a nuclear reactor tour?

89
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,060
Oh man.

90
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,807
OK.

91
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:42,640
Well, you'll get one
when you get to control

92
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,367
the thing in early October.

93
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:46,450
So you actually get to go
down to the control room

94
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,040
and see the rest
of what's going on.

95
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,050
So make sure to ask them,
show us the beam port

96
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,120
for silicon ingots.

97
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,420
And I think I already told you
the story about the poor UROP

98
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,340
who held the ingots
up to their chest,

99
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,358
getting about 10 months of
dose, which is not dangerous,

100
00:04:00,358 --> 00:04:01,900
but it meant that
for 10 months, they

101
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,370
could have no
radiation exposure,

102
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,490
and they had to
answer the phone.

103
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,750
So that's how we ensure
safety around here.

104
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,835
There's other ones that--

105
00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:11,210
applications that
you're probably

106
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,220
carrying around in your pocket.

107
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,630
You can use the
fact that charged

108
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,570
particles have very
finite ranges in matter

109
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,760
to separate little bits of
that matter from other things.

110
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,090
So this is actually how
single-crystal sapphires

111
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,900
can be separated in little
slivers for protective phone

112
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,180
covers, because sapphire
is one of the most--

113
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,430
the hardest, or the most
scratch-resistant materials

114
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,500
there is.

115
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,350
Single-crystal sapphire
is exceptionally strong,

116
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,660
and optically transparent,
and expensive.

117
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,780
I know that because on
one of our experiments,

118
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,190
we use a single-crystal sapphire
window to see into reactor

119
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,790
conditions at like 150
atmospheres, and 350

120
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,550
degrees Celsius, and
pretty corrosive chemistry.

121
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,560
So you want to use as
little as possible.

122
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,840
So you can use a big,
expensive accelerator

123
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,850
to limit the amount of
sapphire that you use.

124
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,070
And this is actually
done here in Boston.

125
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,060
There's a facility not far from
here that uses an accelerator.

126
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,120
And this is their
super detailed diagram

127
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,440
of what the radiation
looks like--

128
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,970
yeah, whatever.

129
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,260
But what they do is they
take-- they accelerate protons.

130
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,090
They send them through
bending magnets

131
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,070
to steer that beam path.

132
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,590
And then they send
them into a large piece

133
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,690
of single-crystal sapphire,
which is exceptionally

134
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,130
expensive to make.

135
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,530
And they can actually
lift off a thin sliver

136
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,480
with micron precision.

137
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,100
The reason for that
is the same reason

138
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,050
that we showed with
that SRIM code.

139
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,140
If you have this exact
energy of protons

140
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,120
going into well-known
matter, you

141
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,930
know what its range is going
to be with an uncertainty

142
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,740
or so of about a micron.

143
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,070
So you can have things that
come out thin, uniformly

144
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,180
thick, and smooth, right away.

145
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,340
There's some other
really wacky products--

146
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:56,020
like has anyone heard of
these betavoltaic batteries?

147
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,990
No?

148
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,040
They rely on beta decay or the
direct capture and electricity

149
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,110
generation from a
radiation source

150
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,730
like radioactive tritium.

151
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,840
So in this little chip is about
2 curies worth of tritium.

152
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,430
You guys will learn
in about a week,

153
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,370
how to go from activity
in curies to mass,

154
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,120
or something like that.

155
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,550
And so this chip
actually contains

156
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,620
a lot of radioactive
tritium that

157
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,770
directly creates electricity.

158
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,520
So you can hook into
that chip and produce

159
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,800
nanowatts for years.

160
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,170
So it's one of these
batteries that lasts-- well,

161
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:31,280
as long as a couple half-lives
of the isotope that's inside.

162
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,720
Now there's a trade-off here.

163
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,270
The shorter the
half-life, the more active

164
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,000
a given isotope will be for
the same number of atoms,

165
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,830
but the shorter it will last.

166
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,700
So you can have higher power
for lower time, or lower power,

167
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,210
higher time.

168
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,250
It's the classic
energy trade-off--

169
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,440
works the same way
with irradiation.

170
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,240
And so now I wanted
to get into some

171
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,250
of the more technical
stuff, where

172
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,920
we'll be talking about
nuclear mass and stability.

173
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,240
And this is where the nuclear
stuff really begins in 22.01.

174
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,100
First, I want to make sure
that we all agree on notation.

175
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,410
So I'll be writing isotopes
in this sort of fashion,

176
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,970
where we refer to A as
the atomic mass, or just

177
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,040
the total number of nucleons.

178
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,680
This is not the exact
mass of a nucleus.

179
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,830
It just refers to the sum
of the protons and neutrons

180
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,123
in the nucleus itself.

181
00:07:19,123 --> 00:07:21,040
And a lot of what we'll
be talking about today

182
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,300
is the difference between
this nice integer mass number,

183
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,100
and the actual mass
of the nucleus,

184
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,950
and that difference is
given by the binding energy,

185
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,170
or the excess mass, which
are directly related.

186
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,420
Z is just referred to
as the atomic number,

187
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,550
or the number of protons.

188
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,450
It's what makes the
element what it,

189
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,510
which makes the name
kind of redundant.

190
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,760
But it's-- humans
learned by association.

191
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,430
It's easier to remember
element names or symbols

192
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:50,320
than which element is which
just by the number of protons.

193
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,820
So a lot of times we'll use the
name, or at least the symbol

194
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,280
just so we know what's going on.

195
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,950
And anything up here is
some sort of a charge.

196
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,520
I do want to warn you guys of
the dreaded multiple symbol

197
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,860
use or multiple use of symbols.

198
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,760
I'll try to stick
for a lower case q--

199
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,270
will be charged.

200
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,490
And uppercase Q
is going to refer

201
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,190
to the Q value or the
energy consumed or released

202
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,420
by a nuclear reaction.

203
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,310
So they're both Q's
but we're going to keep

204
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,882
one upper and lower case.

205
00:08:17,882 --> 00:08:19,340
And like we mentioned
before, let's

206
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,920
say we were to write a
typical nuclear reaction,

207
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,520
like the capture of
neutrons by boron

208
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,180
to produce lithium-7,
helium-4, better

209
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,200
known as an alpha particle,
and some amount of energy.

210
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,440
There's two places where we
actually use this reaction.

211
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,960
One of them is as control rods.

212
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,960
A lot of reactors use
boron for carbide,

213
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,910
or this compound B4C, which
is conveniently solid, fairly

214
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,450
dense, and contains a whole
lot of boron in one place.

215
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,850
Specifically,
enriched in boron-10,

216
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,910
because boron-10 has a high
cross section, or probability,

217
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,308
for neutron capture.

218
00:08:57,308 --> 00:08:58,850
And the other one
is in what's called

219
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,120
boron neutron capture therapy.

220
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,003
Have I discussed this with
you guys already, BNCT?

221
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:05,420
Good, because
that's what we'll be

222
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,250
talking about for a few slides.

223
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,980
And to write this whole
reaction is the same thing

224
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,330
as writing this shorthand
nuclear reaction.

225
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,412
So this is often how you
see them in the reading,

226
00:09:14,412 --> 00:09:16,370
and in papers, because
it's shorter to do that.

227
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,187
But it's the exact same thing.

228
00:09:19,187 --> 00:09:21,270
So I have a couple of
questions for you guys then.

229
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,870
I have this extra Q here.

230
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,210
Where does that Q actually go?

231
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,420
So let's say boron
and neutron absorb,

232
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,660
it produces two nuclei with
different binding energies.

233
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,670
What happens to
the excess energy

234
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,260
created from the conversion
of mass to energy?

235
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:38,840
Yeah, Alex?

236
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,910
AUDIENCE: That could be heat.

237
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,640
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

238
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,973
And heat, and more specifically?

239
00:09:41,973 --> 00:09:43,450
AUDIENCE: Kinetic energy.

240
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:47,027
MICHAEL SHORT: Kinetic energy
of the radiation released.

241
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:48,610
And so that kinetic
energy is actually

242
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,350
used to our benefit in BNCT, or
Boron Neutron Capture Therapy.

243
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,670
The way this works--

244
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,440
once I hit play--

245
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,100
is you can either-- you can use
any sort of source of neutrons,

246
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,860
either a reactor
or an accelerator,

247
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,267
through a lower complex
chain of events, like this.

248
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:07,600
In this case, an accelerator--
so you don't need a whole

249
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,680
reactor--

250
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,590
fires a beam of
high-energy protons

251
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,475
into a beryllium target.

252
00:10:13,475 --> 00:10:15,310
Does that sound fairly familiar?

253
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,980
Firing something at
beryllium, releasing neutrons,

254
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,690
like what Chadwick was doing?

255
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,000
Except he was firing
alpha particles into it.

256
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,890
This releases neutrons.

257
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,040
What they don't have labeled
here is slowing down stuff,

258
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,470
or probably
hydrogenous material,

259
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,890
so that the neutrons slow
down to a lower energy.

260
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,950
And their probability
of capture increases

261
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,530
or their cross
section increases.

262
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,447
And if you don't know
what a cross section is,

263
00:10:39,447 --> 00:10:41,760
the definition is
two slides away.

264
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,280
And the idea here is that these
neutrons then enter the brain

265
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,650
or wherever the
tumor happens to be.

266
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,130
And we rely on the fact that
tumor cells consume resources

267
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,370
much faster than regular cells,
especially neurons, which

268
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,170
after you're about five,
don't tend to grow very much.

269
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,340
So it's all downhill by the
time you enter kindergarten.

270
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,390
And we use that to our advantage
so that the neutrons coming in

271
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,850
will hit the cancer cells,
which will preferentially

272
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,120
uptake the borated
compounds, leaving most

273
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,470
of the normal cells intact.

274
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,200
And the difference in
dose can be a factor of 5

275
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,760
or a factor of 10.

276
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,370
So that the cancer gets fried
while doing as little damage

277
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,250
as possible to the remaining
brain cells, of which we

278
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,320
have fewer and fewer every day.

279
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,910
So I say statistically
speaking you

280
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,440
guys are probably
smarter than me

281
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,670
if we go by number of
neurons in your brain,

282
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,630
because I think I'm the
oldest person in the room.

283
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:35,200
And so now we can start to
explain, how does BNCT work,

284
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,900
and why did we make the
choices that we did?

285
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,350
For example, they use
30 MeV protons in order

286
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,198
to induce these neutrons.

287
00:11:43,198 --> 00:11:45,740
So we have a nuclear reaction
that looks something like this.

288
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,860
We start off with
beryllium-9 plus a proton--

289
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,450
let's just call it
hydrogen to stick

290
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,520
with our normal notation--

291
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,540
and becomes-- well, can someone
help me balance this reaction?

292
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,790
We know we get a neutron.

293
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,975
What else is left?

294
00:12:02,975 --> 00:12:06,650
So Monica, what would you say?

295
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,646
AUDIENCE: Let's see--

296
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,430
MICHAEL SHORT: Even just say
number of protons and neutrons,

297
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,040
and we'll figure out
the symbol later.

298
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,648
AUDIENCE: Number of
protons should be--

299
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:22,190
MICHAEL SHORT: Sorry,
oh, that's a 4.

300
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:25,718
AUDIENCE: The number of
protons should be five.

301
00:12:25,718 --> 00:12:26,510
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

302
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:30,420
Five protons, which
means it's boron.

303
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,578
And number of neutrons
in the nucleus?

304
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:33,120
Someone else?

305
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:36,417
Yeah?

306
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:37,437
AUDIENCE: Nine.

307
00:12:37,437 --> 00:12:38,270
MICHAEL SHORT: Nine.

308
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:41,450
So we have boron-9.

309
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,330
Not a stable isotope of boron,
but it doesn't really matter,

310
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,960
because boron-9 almost
immediately decays into

311
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,310
an alpha, and an
alpha, and a hydrogen.

312
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,628
But this nuclear
reaction right here

313
00:12:54,628 --> 00:12:56,420
is what we'll be studying
for a little bit.

314
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,830
And there'll also be
some amount of energy.

315
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,490
And this Q can actually
be positive or negative.

316
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,710
No one said there had
to be energy released

317
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,450
in a nuclear reaction,
because in this case,

318
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:18,540
we actually start off with 30
MeV protons and roughly zero

319
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,998
MeV beryllium.

320
00:13:19,998 --> 00:13:21,540
If you want to get
really exact, it's

321
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,050
on the order of
about 0.01 eV, which

322
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,810
is why we neglect the
kinetic energy of beryllium

323
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,870
at room temperature.

324
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,960
There are other
reactions that when

325
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,150
you fire a proton
into them will produce

326
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,547
neutrons, such as the
absorption of lithium.

327
00:13:36,547 --> 00:13:38,380
But can anyone think
of why we'd want to use

328
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,880
beryllium instead of lithium?

329
00:13:46,895 --> 00:13:48,020
Kristin, what do you think?

330
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,340
What could be a bad thing
about using lithium?

331
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,984
You ever throw in water?

332
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:55,880
AUDIENCE: No.

333
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,630
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

334
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,088
Then I should show
you what happens

335
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,110
when you throw it in water.

336
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,850
There's a few bad
things about lithium.

337
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,400
It does this when you
throw it in water.

338
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,170
It's one of the alkali metals.

339
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,540
It's got an awfully
low melting point.

340
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,910
It reacts with oxygen to
produce an oxide almost

341
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,880
instantaneously.

342
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,760
So if you ever take a
lithium battery apart,

343
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,700
which you shouldn't, but if
you watch the video of somebody

344
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,340
else doing it, you'll see that
the lithium foil turns black

345
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,570
almost instantly.

346
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,550
It also has a pretty
poor thermal conductivity

347
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,610
and doesn't hold that structural
integrity when it melts.

348
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:28,518
So it's not that good
of a target to use.

349
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:30,560
Beryllium's pretty cool
in that it's the lightest

350
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,275
structural material there is.

351
00:14:32,275 --> 00:14:33,650
Folks tend to make
satellites out

352
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,690
of it, because it
costs a lot of money

353
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,077
to launch things into space.

354
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:39,410
And if you want something
that has a high melting point,

355
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,440
and is light, and is structural,
beryllium's your way to go.

356
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,800
It also happens to be a
great neutron generator.

357
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,230
And then why 30 MeV?

358
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,950
In this case, we're going
to use a table called JANIS,

359
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:56,230
which I've got open over here.

360
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,407
And I just have to clone my
screen so you can see it.

361
00:14:59,407 --> 00:15:01,990
This is a resource that I think
you guys are going to be using

362
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,670
quite a lot in this course.

363
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,038
We have a link to it on
the learning module site.

364
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,080
And I'm going to show you
how it works right now.

365
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,690
So I tend to use the web
version because it works

366
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,460
on any browser, any computer.

367
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,080
And now you can start to pick
which nuclear reaction you're

368
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,830
looking at.

369
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:20,230
And you can get
tabulated cross sections.

370
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,760
So I'm going to start by
zooming all the way out.

371
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,715
We can pick our
incident particle.

372
00:15:25,715 --> 00:15:27,090
Since in this
case, we're looking

373
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,870
at the firing of
protons into beryllium,

374
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,680
I'll pick the incident
proton data right here.

375
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,410
There's a lot of different
databases with sometimes

376
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,450
conflicting information.

377
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,870
I tend to go with the most
recent one you can find.

378
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,850
And click on cross sections.

379
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,190
And this is, again another
table of nuclides, anything

380
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,990
in green there's data for.

381
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,640
Anything in gray, there isn't.

382
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,980
So let's go all the way
back to the light nuclei,

383
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,840
zoom in, go back down
to the light nuclei

384
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,910
again until we find beryllium-9.

385
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:12,110
Double-click on that, and
let's look for the anything

386
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,700
cross section.

387
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,870
And this is a pretty
wide energy scale.

388
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,990
So you can actually change
your X minimum and maximum.

389
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,970
So let's change it to
a minimum and maximum--

390
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,590
I don't know-- a
maximum of 50 MeV.

391
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:30,260
We don't have to see all of
that other stuff going on.

392
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:35,020
50 MeV and maybe
a minimum of 10.

393
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,970
If you notice-- actually,
I'll go back to 1.

394
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,490
And I want to point
something out.

395
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:43,775
You can actually get a
good yield of beryllium.

396
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,150
Let's see-- you can actually
get a good yield of neutrons

397
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,940
by firing protons at
beryllium in lower energies.

398
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,090
But I notice there's
this interesting feature

399
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,410
right around there.

400
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,577
The cross section's flatter.

401
00:16:54,577 --> 00:16:55,827
And so if you want to get an--

402
00:16:55,827 --> 00:16:57,310
ensure that you
get the right dose,

403
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,530
you might want to deal
with a flatter cross

404
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,308
section or a flatter
probability region,

405
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:03,100
so that you have
something more predictable

406
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,230
instead of in a really
high slope region.

407
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,849
But some of these
nuclear reactions

408
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:11,480
actually take extra energy
in order to move forward.

409
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,690
And we'll show you another
example pretty quickly.

410
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:19,020
Let's go back to
our slides here.

411
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,240
Then another question
is, how does the boron

412
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,220
only get into the cancer cells?

413
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,810
Like we mentioned
before, cancer cells

414
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,609
are actively
growing, which means

415
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:29,820
they need a very large
and active blood supply.

416
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,670
And so it's one way for
things to, let's say,

417
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,980
not quite cross the
blood-brain barrier.

418
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,190
If the cancer cells are growing
and your neurons aren't, then

419
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,605
your cancer cells are going
to use more energy, take

420
00:17:40,605 --> 00:17:43,290
in more sugar, which
might be doped with boron,

421
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,005
or some other compound
doped with boron,

422
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:47,130
and that's all you can get
the boron into the cells

423
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,960
that you want.

424
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,870
And then why was boron
selected for the therapy?

425
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,130
Let's think about that.

426
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:58,490
What happens after the
neutron is created?

427
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:02,180
And let's write the next
stage of the reaction.

428
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,870
In boron neutron
capture therapy,

429
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:10,260
we rely on doping the patient
with boron-10 to release

430
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:21,510
an alpha particle, and
lithium-7 and a gamma ray.

431
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,922
So now what we
can start doing is

432
00:18:22,922 --> 00:18:25,380
look at the table of nuclides,
which I'm going to teach you

433
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,630
how to read now, to
figure out-- let's

434
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,560
say that this neutron had
an energy of about zero eV

435
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:36,120
and the boron nucleus had
an energy of about zero eV.

436
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:42,780
And in the end, all this
stuff here has gained or lost

437
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,360
some sort of energy
cue, Q. And today we're

438
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,200
going to teach you how
to calculate this Q.

439
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,330
So I want to skip ahead to how
to read the table of nuclides.

440
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,320
So there's all-- this is
like the poster you'll

441
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,570
see in every nuclear building.

442
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,303
It's kind of what makes us, us.

443
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,220
What you'll notice is
that there's a whole lot

444
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,070
of nuclei at the lower left.

445
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,940
They are the light ones.

446
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,340
At the upper right, they
are the heavier ones.

447
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,040
And they're colored
by half-life.

448
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,620
In general, the blue
ones will be stable,

449
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,320
and the further away you get
from blue, the less stable

450
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,185
they get.

451
00:19:14,185 --> 00:19:16,560
So right away, without even
delving deeper, what patterns

452
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,560
do you guys notice here?

453
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,310
Yeah, Alex?

454
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,897
AUDIENCE: As they get bigger,
heavier, they're more unstable.

455
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:25,730
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

456
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:29,082
There's a whole section
where there's no more blue.

457
00:19:29,082 --> 00:19:30,290
There are no stable elements.

458
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,590
So stability drops off
after a certain point.

459
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,890
And what about in the
region of stable isotopes?

460
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,950
Does anybody notice any
repeating patterns here?

461
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,000
Take a look at every other row.

462
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,040
There's a bunch of
blues and then one,

463
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,090
and then a bunch and then one,
and then more and then none.

464
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,310
That must be technetium,
because that's

465
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,920
the only element around
there that doesn't have any.

466
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,050
And then a bunch of blues.

467
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,310
So every other row--

468
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,550
and in this case, it's
increasing number of protons--

469
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,490
has more or fewer
stable isotopes.

470
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,280
It turns out that
the even numbered

471
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,070
isotopes have a lot more stable
ones, for reasons that we'll

472
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,900
get into pretty soon.

473
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,598
If you zoom in a
little bit, you can

474
00:20:14,598 --> 00:20:16,140
see all the different
isotopes so you

475
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,460
can select which ones you want.

476
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,600
And again, if you look
really closely, that's--

477
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,370
let's say, neon right here
has got a few stable ones.

478
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,840
Sodium has one.

479
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,890
Magnesium as three.

480
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,240
Aluminum has one.

481
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,872
And this pattern
repeats all the way up

482
00:20:28,872 --> 00:20:30,330
to the point where
you don't really

483
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,730
get any more stable isotopes.

484
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,525
If you double-click
on one of them,

485
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,150
you get all the
information that you'll

486
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,740
need for the next three
or so weeks of the course.

487
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,250
So in this case, I
picked on sulfur-32,

488
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,530
one of the stable
isotopes of sulfur.

489
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,800
So if you notice it doesn't
have any decay mechanisms here,

490
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,200
but it does say its
atomic abundance.

491
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,270
So you can know how-- what
percentage is normally

492
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,470
found in nature.

493
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,660
And then there's a
few other quantities

494
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,180
that is going to be the topic
of what's going on here.

495
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,670
Let's start with
the atomic mass.

496
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:04,290
If you notice, the atomic
mass is slightly less than 32,

497
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,950
32 being the mass number, or
the total number of protons

498
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,690
plus neutrons in the nucleus.

499
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:15,140
The actual mass is a
little lower by that amount

500
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,655
right there, the binding energy.

501
00:21:17,655 --> 00:21:19,280
It might be a little
funny because I've

502
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,060
given you a mass in AMU, and a
binding energy in kiloelectron

503
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,110
volts.

504
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:28,410
I want to remind you that
these are the same thing.

505
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:32,000
The conversion factor you'll
be using over and over again

506
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,270
throughout this course,
especially on the next p sets,

507
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:46,600
is one atomic mass unit
is 931.49 MeV c squared.

508
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,172
Yeah-- I'm sorry.

509
00:21:51,172 --> 00:21:53,470
Yeah, never mind,
put that there.

510
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,763
So then, again,
one, don't round--

511
00:21:55,763 --> 00:21:57,430
because we've had
times when folks said,

512
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,380
ah, this is about 931.

513
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,922
And when you're
off by half an MeV,

514
00:22:01,922 --> 00:22:03,880
you could be at a totally
different decay level

515
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,838
or get a positive Q when
it should be negative,

516
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:07,050
or vice versa.

517
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,220
And let's take a quick
look here to say,

518
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:15,292
if this atomic mass
is 31.9720707 AMU--

519
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,750
this is why I
brought a calculator.

520
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,520
Normally I do mental,
math but since I

521
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,770
told you guys don't
round, I can't

522
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,950
do eight significant
digits in my head.

523
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,025
So I'm going to
get that in there--

524
00:22:26,025 --> 00:22:27,043
0707.

525
00:22:27,043 --> 00:22:28,710
If any of you guys
want to follow along,

526
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,570
I encourage you to.

527
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,660
And say minus 32, which
is the mass number.

528
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:40,260
So in this case we're taking
the actual atomic mass

529
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,150
minus the actual--

530
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,560
the mass number.

531
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,700
In this case, it's 32.

532
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:52,070
In this case it's, 31.9720707.

533
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,580
And we end up with minus 0.0--

534
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,070
I'm going to put all
the digits here--

535
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:01,840
293 AMU.

536
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,750
If we convert this to MeV--

537
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:18,270
times 931.49, we get
minus 26.0159 MeV.

538
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:23,170
See this number anywhere
on the KAERI table?

539
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,435
Right there-- that's
the excess mass.

540
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,110
And in this case, we usually
give this the symbol delta

541
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,220
for the excess mass.

542
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,800
And these are how
these quantities

543
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,030
are directly related.

544
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,620
The excess mass--
well, actually,

545
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,450
what does the excess
mass really mean?

546
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:44,450
It's the difference
between the actual mass

547
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,870
and a fairly poor
approximation of the mass.

548
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,060
So the excess mass
doesn't really

549
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,160
have that much of a
physical connotation.

550
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,180
But it is nice, because
if you know very well

551
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,790
the tabulated atomic number--

552
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,240
I'm sorry, the-- yeah, the mass
number and the excess mass,

553
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,100
you can figure out--

554
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,020
let's see-- yeah,
you can figure out

555
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,640
what the real atomic mass is.

556
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:14,130
And I want to switch now to
the actual table of nuclides

557
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:16,420
and show you one example.

558
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,510
If you want to very quickly
jump between isotopes,

559
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:21,302
you can type them
in right up here.

560
00:24:21,302 --> 00:24:23,760
And does anyone know what the
gold standard for atomic mass

561
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,260
is?

562
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,010
And I'll give you a
hint, it's not gold.

563
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:26,510
Yep?

564
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,510
AUDIENCE: Carbon-12.

565
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,860
MICHAEL SHORT: Carbon-12.

566
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,653
What do you think the
excess mass of carbon-12

567
00:24:31,653 --> 00:24:33,570
is going to be without
doing any calculations?

568
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,500
AUDIENCE: Zero.

569
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,600
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

570
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,990
Zero.

571
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:40,230
So if we go to
carbon-12, because that

572
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:44,250
is set as the standard, the
way atomic masses were done

573
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,540
was carbon-12 weighs
exactly 12 AMU.

574
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,480
The excess mass here is zero.

575
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,320
And that's why the atomic mass
is 12.0 to as many decimals

576
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,060
as we care to note.

577
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,230
So is everyone clear
on what excess mass is?

578
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:00,730
Yep?

579
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:04,360
AUDIENCE: What's the point of
c squared for that conversion?

580
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,970
MICHAEL SHORT: So mass
does not actually equal--

581
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:09,035
oh right, and it's
actually on the--

582
00:25:09,035 --> 00:25:10,700
where did my chalk go?

583
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,830
It's actually down below.

584
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:18,180
The point is that energy is
related to mass by c squared.

585
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,930
So they're not the
same units, but they're

586
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,536
directly convertible.

587
00:25:21,536 --> 00:25:22,410
AUDIENCE: OK.

588
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,470
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

589
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:26,410
And so this way, you have
an E over a c squared.

590
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,610
You get an m, and there we go.

591
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,620
I had the units upside down.

592
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:38,570
However, carbon-12 does not
have a zero binding energy.

593
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,370
Yeah, Luke?

594
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,815
AUDIENCE: How come when
you did that calculation,

595
00:25:41,815 --> 00:25:44,140
you didn't use the c squared?

596
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:49,750
So like, it seems like then
that would be 26.0159--

597
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,840
MICHAEL SHORT:
MeV per c squared.

598
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,340
Yeah.

599
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,980
AUDIENCE: But they don't
say that up there--

600
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,435
or it didn't say
that on the table.

601
00:25:57,435 --> 00:25:58,810
MICHAEL SHORT:
Yeah, that's true.

602
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:02,650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

603
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,660
MICHAEL SHORT: So
it is funny, right?

604
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,090
The binding energy is give it
in keV, and that's correct.

605
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,500
An energy is an energy.

606
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,730
An excess mass, it
really should say

607
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:14,290
keV per c squared, because if
we're talking in units of mass,

608
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,540
it's got to be in m.

609
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:21,710
Or in this way, you could say
m is an energy per c squared.

610
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:26,020
So this, to me, is a semantic
inconsistency in the table.

611
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,120
But you guys will know
that a mass is always

612
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,270
going to be an AMU,
or kilograms, or MeV

613
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,730
per c squared.

614
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:37,150
And energies will be in
MeV, keV, some sort of eV,

615
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,370
usually, in this course.

616
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,520
The binding energy,
though, that's correct.

617
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,280
That's in keV, because
that's an actual energy.

618
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,530
Now then the question is,
what does the binding energy

619
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,580
actually represent?

620
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,680
Does anyone remember
from Friday or Thursday?

621
00:26:54,762 --> 00:26:56,470
I can refresh your
memory, because that's

622
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,800
what I'm here to do.

623
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,850
The binding energy
is as if-- let's say

624
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:05,600
we're assembling carbon-12
from its constituent nucleons.

625
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,970
There's going to be 12 of them.

626
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:14,565
Let's say we had six
protons and six neutrons.

627
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,080
We can calculate the
total mass energy

628
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,560
of this ensemble of nucleons
when they're infinitely

629
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,730
far apart from each other.

630
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,110
And forgive the little--

631
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,370
it's not to scale.

632
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:31,820
But they are infinitely
far apart from each other.

633
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,350
And we can say that--

634
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,780
let's say there is
Z number of protons.

635
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,080
So we'll say the
binding energy is

636
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,910
the number of protons
times the mass of a proton

637
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,150
plus the number of neutrons--

638
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,600
A minus Z-- times
the mass of a neutron

639
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,950
minus the energy of the
assembled carbon-12 nucleus.

640
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,860
So there's actually a
measurable difference

641
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:10,590
in mass between six
protons and six neutrons,

642
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:16,980
and the actual mass of a nucleus
with atomic number A and--

643
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:22,026
I'm sorry, with atomic number
Z and mass number A c squared.

644
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,360
So is everyone clear on how
we arrived at this formula?

645
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,310
It's effectively
the energy released

646
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:34,180
when you take the individual
nucleons, assemble the nucleus.

647
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,430
You don't have as much
mass as when you started.

648
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,620
Or in some cases, you might
have a little more mass

649
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:42,760
than when you started if things
are particularly unstable.

650
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,730
And you can use the excess
mass and binding energies

651
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:50,320
in relative amounts to see, is
a nucleus going to be stable?

652
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,500
For example, let's
look at iron-55 I'm

653
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,150
going to jump here,
make it a little bigger

654
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:59,560
so the important stuff
is easier to see.

655
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:03,657
And if you notice, the
binding energy of iron-55--

656
00:29:03,657 --> 00:29:04,740
there's quite a bit of it.

657
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,940
It's very well-bound.

658
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,780
In fact, this is one of
the most well-bound nuclei

659
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,330
in the whole chart of nuclides.

660
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,830
Let's look at
something that we know

661
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,400
to be particularly unstable.

662
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,670
Someone have any idea?

663
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:21,580
Let's just add like
20 neutrons to iron

664
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,810
let's see if it even exists.

665
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,260
No-- doesn't happen.

666
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,930
Let's try adding 10
neutrons to iron--

667
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,100
or go even crazier.

668
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,570
What about 70?

669
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:39,090
Too small-- all right, let's
meet somewhere in the middle--

670
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,780
68.

671
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,238
Still a pretty high
binding energy,

672
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,822
but you can look at
it as a difference

673
00:29:43,822 --> 00:29:45,175
in binding energy per nucleon.

674
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,500
So in this case, the
binding energy per nucleon--

675
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,660
if you take the binding
energy and divide

676
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,580
by the total number of
nucleons, will give you

677
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,660
a relative measure of how
tightly bound that nucleus is.

678
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,430
Now these are not
absolute things.

679
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,630
You can't just say,
certain binding energy

680
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,630
leads to certain stability,
but they do give you

681
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,752
pretty good trends to follow.

682
00:30:06,752 --> 00:30:08,710
And we're actually going
to be coming up with--

683
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,570
probably on Thursday--

684
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:14,050
a semi-empirical formula to
get the rough binding energy

685
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:17,110
of any particular assembly
of protons and neutrons.

686
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:21,580
And it follows experimental
calculations pretty well--

687
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,382
surprisingly so.

688
00:30:24,382 --> 00:30:26,090
I want to jump back
to here, because I've

689
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:29,720
mentioned cross sections,
and I want to actually define

690
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,120
what a cross section is,
because this is a quantity

691
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,850
that you're going to
be using everywhere.

692
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:37,130
Let's say that we fired
a beam of particles--

693
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,960
it doesn't matter what it is--

694
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,630
at a target of other particles.

695
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:44,450
Let's say, the beam
particles are atom A,

696
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,970
and the target
particles are atom B.

697
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,210
And once these A particles
pass through the target

698
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,790
B, a little bit
fewer of them come

699
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:56,780
out the other side reacted,
or unscathed, or unscattered.

700
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:00,050
And some of them are absorbed,
or scattered, or bounced off,

701
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,870
or scattered backwards,
or what have you.

702
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,790
We can write the sort
of proportionality

703
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:09,140
constant between the change
in intensity of our A beam

704
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,230
and the thickness of our slab.

705
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,000
And we give that
proportionality constant

706
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,500
this symbol, little sigma.

707
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,490
We'll get something
going up here.

708
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:22,225
Little sigma, which we call
the microscopic cross section.

709
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,970
It's in effect, a constant
of proportionality

710
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,910
that relates the
probability of absorbing

711
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,640
an atom from this beam I--

712
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,220
or from this beam of atoms
A through a slab of B.

713
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,800
And then if you
take this formula,

714
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,350
you divide by that delta X--

715
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:49,210
so I'm going to
take what's on there

716
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:55,530
and say delta I over delta
X equals minus cross section

717
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,990
ABn--

718
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:01,180
which refers here to
the number density.

719
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,150
So I'll keep our
table of symbols

720
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,265
altogether so it's a
little easier to follow.

721
00:32:05,265 --> 00:32:15,490
n is our number density, which
means the number of atoms

722
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:17,740
per unit volume.

723
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,670
Usually, in nuclear
quantities, we use centimeters

724
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,520
because these are things that
are actually fairly measurable,

725
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,410
and cross sections
are actually in units

726
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:31,880
of centimeters squared.

727
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,160
And let me finish
that expression.

728
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,050
We had the number
density of our target

729
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:43,300
B. We had our initial
intensity, and that's it.

730
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:47,360
Anyone know how to solve
this differential equation?

731
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,856
If we take the limit
of small deltas,

732
00:32:51,856 --> 00:32:55,888
it should start to look like
a differential equation.

733
00:32:55,888 --> 00:32:57,680
The final answer is up
there on the screen.

734
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,810
Does anyone remember the
method to actually solve

735
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:00,935
this differential equation?

736
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,990
This is the easy one--

737
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,130
separate the variables.

738
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:09,970
So in this case, we can
divide each side by I of of X,

739
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:13,720
multiply each side by X.
I'm going to bring this up

740
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,630
so I'm not bending down.

741
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:25,300
So we have dI over I equals
minus sigma ab n of B times dX.

742
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:33,340
Integrate both sides
and we get log of I

743
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:45,160
equals minus sigma ab n of BX,
and some integration constant.

744
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,780
You can apply an initial
boundary condition to say at X

745
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:53,050
equals zero, the
intensity of the being

746
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:55,690
x was some intensity I naught.

747
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,700
Whatever intensity of the
beam that we initially

748
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,020
fired at the target.

749
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,200
And by combining
these two, you end up

750
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,420
with the expression
you get right there,

751
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:08,440
which is that the intensity
of the beam coming out

752
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:14,230
is the initial intensity times
e to the minus sigma ab nbx.

753
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,370
And we've kind of
derived the idea

754
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,670
of exponential attenuation.

755
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:26,480
For those who haven't
seen that word before,

756
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,440
attenuation or the gradual
removal of the beam of incident

757
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,870
particles by whatever
the target happens to be.

758
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,870
This quantity right
here, we actually

759
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:45,480
have another symbol for it,
which we give big sigma.

760
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,248
And in this case, big sigma
we call the macroscopic cross

761
00:34:50,248 --> 00:34:50,847
section.

762
00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:59,940
I'll draw a box
around these so we

763
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:04,020
know these are our symbols that
we're keeping defined here.

764
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,960
And so you may see that the
microscopic cross section just

765
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,575
depends on single reactions
between the incoming atoms

766
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:14,970
A and the target atoms B.
The macroscopic cross section

767
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,650
depends on how much B is there.

768
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:22,170
So if you want to get per atom
probabilities of absorption

769
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:24,660
scattering, whatever
thing you're looking at,

770
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,210
you use the microscopic
cross section.

771
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,980
And if you have a finite
amount of stuff there,

772
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,640
and you know the number
density of your substance B,

773
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,790
you can use the
macroscopic cross section

774
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:38,910
to get actual total
probabilities of beam

775
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,260
attenuation--

776
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,320
or to calculate
exponential attenuation.

777
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,750
We're going to see this
again in another form when

778
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,970
we talk about
designing shielding,

779
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,470
and how much
shielding do you need

780
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,930
to remove how much of the beam?

781
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:54,060
Well, this quantity
right here, there's

782
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,360
actually tabulated values for
a lot of this stuff at the--

783
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,680
on the NIST website.

784
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,500
And I have links to that as
well on the Stellar website,

785
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,650
so you can-- instead of having
to look these all up on JANIS

786
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,150
and multiply number
densities, there

787
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,430
are some easier graphical
functions you can just

788
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,110
find the value for.

789
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,880
But we'll get back to
that in a few days.

790
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,770
So anyway, on reading
the KAERI table,

791
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:19,770
there's a few
quantities right there.

792
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,380
We've already defined
what the excess mass

793
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,330
and the binding energy is.

794
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,890
And I want to note
right here, if you

795
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,710
want to actually calculate
binding energies by hand, which

796
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,765
I'm going to ask you to
do a bit on problem set 2,

797
00:36:31,765 --> 00:36:33,765
you'll need to know what
the mass of the proton,

798
00:36:33,765 --> 00:36:35,910
and the neutron,
and the electron

799
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:38,760
are to, again, usually
like six or seven digits

800
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,970
is the idea behind this course.

801
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:45,240
Notice that they're not
exactly one atomic mass unit,

802
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,860
because one atomic
mass unit, again,

803
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,523
was set with that
carbon-12 standard.

804
00:36:48,523 --> 00:36:50,940
I'm not going to use the word
gold standard because that's

805
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,570
a misnomer in this field.

806
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,940
And so like I said, what
does excess mass really mean,

807
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,530
physically?

808
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,990
Not much, because
it's the comparison

809
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:03,900
to an arbitrary standard or
a rather poor approximation

810
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,890
of the mass.

811
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:08,250
The binding energy actually
does represent the conversion

812
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,290
of mass to energy
when you assemble

813
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:15,980
a nucleus like Voltron-style
from its constituent nucleons.

814
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,070
So let's try a few examples
in class right here.

815
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:21,210
I'd like you guys to follow
around and try and calculate

816
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:26,700
the binding energy of each of
these three nuclei of sulfur.

817
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:31,400
Let me get a better blank
board so we can follow along.

818
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,660
And there's a few different
ways of calculating

819
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,980
that binding energy.

820
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,410
You can do it by
the excess mass.

821
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:38,850
You can do it by--

822
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,630
let's go back to the
table of nuclides

823
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,240
so I can show you
how I would do it.

824
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,870
Let's start with sulfur 32.

825
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:48,426
And we'll write up the
quantities that we're--

826
00:37:48,426 --> 00:37:50,000
that we know.

827
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,860
Let's say the excess
mass is the actual mass

828
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,800
minus the mass number.

829
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:04,950
The binding energy is Z times
mass of hydrogen plus A minus Z

830
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:09,870
mass of a neutron minus the
actual mass of that nucleus

831
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:14,100
with AZ c squared.

832
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:19,290
And then what we can do is
rearrange this excess mass,

833
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:23,120
isolating the mass term right
here, and make a substitution.

834
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,740
So we can say the
mass is actually

835
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:32,820
the excess mass plus A.
Stick that in right there,

836
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,730
and now we can calculate and
confirm the binding energies

837
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:40,170
that we see right here from
tabulated excess mass values,

838
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:45,120
atomic number, mass number,
and the masses of a hydrogen

839
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:51,330
atom and a neutron,
which, for reference,

840
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:54,100
I'll write up here as well.

841
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,330
So the mass of a
hydrogen is the mass

842
00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:00,120
of a proton plus an electron.

843
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:10,110
So 1.0072-- 007276 plus 0.000--

844
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:12,480
make that a little
easier to read--

845
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:20,360
how many zeros-- 00054858 AMU.

846
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:27,180
Mass of a neutron, surprisingly
close to Chadwick's prediction.

847
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:33,120
8664 AMU.

848
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:37,420
So now I'll head back to
the table of nuclides.

849
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:40,110
And let's see if you
guys can follow along.

850
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,750
What we want to do is try
to confirm this binding

851
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:46,020
energy using the atomic
mass, the excess mass,

852
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,630
or if we don't even
know the atomic mass,

853
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:53,070
we can use the excess
mass plus A right there.

854
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:58,650
So let's see-- Z, in this
case, for sulfur, is 16 times

855
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:01,740
the mass of hydrogen. This
is definitely a calculator

856
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,325
moment, because like I said,
I don't know about you guys,

857
00:40:04,325 --> 00:40:06,450
but I can't do eight
significant digits in my head.

858
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:21,930
0054858-- 1.007855--
probably enough digits--

859
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:24,510
plus 16, because there's--

860
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,750
mass number here is 32.

861
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,050
The atomic number is 16.

862
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:32,370
That leaves us with 16 neutrons
times the mass of a neutron,

863
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:36,120
08664--

864
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:47,670
minus the excess mass, which
in this case is 26.015 MeV--

865
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:52,770
015 MeV per c squared.

866
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:55,560
So thanks for that-- thank
Jared for that question because,

867
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,517
indeed, the excess
mass, if you want

868
00:40:57,517 --> 00:40:59,100
to write it in terms
of a mass, should

869
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:04,150
be in MeV or keV per
c squared minus A,

870
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:09,090
which is 32 times c squared.

871
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,490
So let's do all this out--

872
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:16,630
shouldn't take too long.

873
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:20,730
007825 plus 16--

874
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:38,610
1.008664 minus 32 minus
26.015 divided by c squared.

875
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:39,740
It's basically nothing.

876
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:46,310
Gives us on the order of--

877
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,845
let's see-- times c squared.

878
00:42:10,975 --> 00:42:12,100
What did we get right here?

879
00:42:18,792 --> 00:42:21,182
AUDIENCE: Is the 26 negative?

880
00:42:21,182 --> 00:42:23,600
MICHAEL SHORT: Ah, let's see.

881
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,400
I believe it is, because we
have to subtract the mass,

882
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,758
and we're substituting
in this delta--

883
00:42:28,758 --> 00:42:30,710
AUDIENCE: Isn't
the delta negative?

884
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,250
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh.

885
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,150
Good point.

886
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:35,280
There is a negative there.

887
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,780
So that's minus negative that.

888
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,740
And A is 32.

889
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,222
Thank you.

890
00:42:42,222 --> 00:42:42,930
Yeah, good point.

891
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:43,847
Let me try this again.

892
00:43:12,865 --> 00:43:16,500
Ah, I know what I'm doing wrong.

893
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,340
This part right here, we
want to convert to AMU.

894
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:23,400
So we can take our minus--

895
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:32,670
thank you-- 26.015 MeV
per c squared and divide

896
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:38,544
by our conversion
factor, 931.49--

897
00:43:38,544 --> 00:43:42,350
let's see-- MeV per
c squared per AMU.

898
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,590
What does that give us?

899
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:51,850
26.015 over that.

900
00:43:51,850 --> 00:44:00,630
0.027928 AMU negative.

901
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:02,460
Let's put that in
and see how we do.

902
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:24,330
So plus 0.027928 minus 32.

903
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:28,440
And then we get 271.--

904
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,530
I'll just say 764 MeV.

905
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:34,630
I think six digits is enough.

906
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,770
The actual binding
energy, 271.780 MeV,

907
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:41,650
so we're off by 16
electron volts--

908
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:43,060
close enough.

909
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:45,710
Also note that I used a
five-digit accurate conversion

910
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:46,210
factor.

911
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:47,460
That might be part
of the source of it.

912
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,870
Does someone have a question?

913
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:49,515
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

914
00:44:49,515 --> 00:44:52,300
In the equation on top,
you did the atomic number

915
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,758
times the mass of the proton,
but in the one on the bottom,

916
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:56,216
you used atomic
mass times the mass

917
00:44:56,216 --> 00:44:58,590
of the hydrogen
including the electron.

918
00:44:58,590 --> 00:44:59,522
Is there--

919
00:44:59,522 --> 00:45:00,480
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh yeah.

920
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,800
I actually added the two.

921
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,100
So the mass of an electron,
since it's got that extra zero,

922
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,960
makes so much of a--

923
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,040
so the mass of--

924
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:08,683
oh-- yeah.

925
00:45:08,683 --> 00:45:10,350
The mass of hydrogen
would be the proton

926
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:11,983
plus the electron right there.

927
00:45:11,983 --> 00:45:12,650
AUDIENCE: Right.

928
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:16,423
But why do hydrogen, though,
if [INAUDIBLE] just the proton?

929
00:45:16,423 --> 00:45:18,840
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, because
there's an electron there, too.

930
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,850
Now this can
usually be neglected

931
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:22,890
because it's such a
small fraction compared

932
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:23,880
to everything else.

933
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,338
So now we're talking
about-- what--

934
00:45:25,338 --> 00:45:29,410
the fifth or sixth
decimal place.

935
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:32,070
But just for exactness,
I stuck on it.

936
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:34,470
Yeah, in your calculations,
you can try with and without,

937
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:36,845
and I think you'll find that
it doesn't matter that much,

938
00:45:36,845 --> 00:45:39,780
because in the end we get the
binding energy that we see

939
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:44,460
on the table to within 16
electron volts for a total

940
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,180
of-- yeah--

941
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,380
271 MeV.

942
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,790
That's pretty accurate.

943
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:48,480
Yeah.

944
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,980
AUDIENCE: If you
wanted to calculate

945
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,840
the like energy released
from a reaction,

946
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,070
would you do the binding energy
for [INAUDIBLE] reactants

947
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:56,868
that's trapped products
for the reactants?

948
00:45:56,868 --> 00:45:58,410
MICHAEL SHORT: That's
the next slide.

949
00:45:58,410 --> 00:45:59,600
We'll get right there.

950
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,960
Yeah, so you're catching
on to where we're going.

951
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,860
So once you can calculate
either the excess mass,

952
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:08,753
or the binding energy, or the
total mass of any nucleus,

953
00:46:08,753 --> 00:46:10,170
you can start to
put them together

954
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,340
into nuclear reactions.

955
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:14,500
So since you asked, let's
take a quick look at them.

956
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,772
Where is our nuclear
reaction board?

957
00:46:16,772 --> 00:46:18,480
Anyone mind if I hide
this board for now,

958
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,264
so we can go back
to our original?

959
00:46:20,264 --> 00:46:20,764
OK.

960
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:27,520
Let's take a look at
this reaction right

961
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:33,110
here, the actual boron neutron
capture therapy reaction.

962
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:37,360
And now we can get towards
calculating this Q, what

963
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,910
the difference is between the--

964
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:42,460
the total energies of the
products and the reactants,

965
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,150
and where does that go?

966
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:46,540
So now we can either
look up or calculate

967
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:49,840
the binding energy of
each of these nuclei,

968
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,720
subtract off the energy of the
gamma, which I've looked up

969
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:59,380
already, is about 0.478 MeV.

970
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:02,770
And we can figure out what the
total Q of this reaction is.

971
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:03,753
So in this case--

972
00:47:03,753 --> 00:47:05,170
I'll skip ahead
to the slide where

973
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:08,980
I've got it because that way
I won't write anything wrong

974
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,420
on the board--

975
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:12,220
got everything right up here.

976
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,680
We assume that both
boron and the neutron

977
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,720
have roughly zero
kinetic energy.

978
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,700
And at the end,
they come out with

979
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:22,180
some other kinetic energies
as well as this gamma ray.

980
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:25,960
The sum of this energy
differences, we refer to as Q.

981
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,930
And we can actually
confirm this total Q

982
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:31,195
with a few different methods.

983
00:47:31,195 --> 00:47:33,070
In this case, it's always
conserve something.

984
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:34,750
That's the whole
theme of this course,

985
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:36,880
is you can conserve
total masses,

986
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,650
you can conserve total
kinetic energies.

987
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:43,120
We may not know those, but
tabulated in the KAERI table

988
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,770
are the binding energies
of each of these nuclei.

989
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:47,320
So let's try that out right now.

990
00:47:50,515 --> 00:47:52,390
So let's look at the
binding energies of each

991
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:55,090
of these nuclei and see
what the difference is,

992
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:56,890
the total energy released.

993
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:00,760
First of all, what's the binding
energy of a lone neutron?

994
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,160
Anyone have any idea?

995
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,220
I see a lot of these--

996
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:03,720
zero.

997
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,498
Yep.

998
00:48:04,498 --> 00:48:06,790
You haven't assembled an
nucleus out of a lone neutron,

999
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:14,500
so we'll go with the neutron has
a binding energy of zero MeV.

1000
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,480
Boron, not quite
the case, but we

1001
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,160
can go back to the table of
nuclides and punch that in--

1002
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,360
boron-10.

1003
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,800
We can look up its
binding energy,

1004
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,250
which is about 64.7507--

1005
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:40,200
I keep saying about, which
is exactly 64.7507 MeV.

1006
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,410
And then our other
two nuclei, helium-4--

1007
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:48,300
so you can punch
in helium-4 here.

1008
00:48:48,300 --> 00:49:03,040
It's got a binding energy
of exactly 28.295673 MeV.

1009
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:10,055
And finally, lithium-7,
let's punch that in.

1010
00:49:10,055 --> 00:49:11,430
I think you guys
are going to get

1011
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:12,810
very familiar with this table.

1012
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:14,580
There's a few
versions out there.

1013
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,380
There's a new slick
Java version that I

1014
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,620
found a little hard to use.

1015
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:20,520
So I like the text-only version,
because it's just as simple

1016
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,410
and fast as it gets--

1017
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:34,180
39.244526-- 526.

1018
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:38,770
So any sort of increase in
total amount of binding energy

1019
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:42,310
between the reactants
and the products

1020
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:45,190
is going to release
or absorb energy.

1021
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:49,900
Now because boron does capture
a thermal neutron, or a neutron

1022
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:53,170
with approximately zero
eV of kinetic energy,

1023
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:55,210
does anyone have any
idea whether this would

1024
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:58,450
release or consume energy?

1025
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:01,450
In other words, do think this
is an exothermic or endothermic

1026
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:04,120
reaction?

1027
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:04,817
Yeah, Alex?

1028
00:50:04,817 --> 00:50:06,400
AUDIENCE: I'm guessing
that heat would

1029
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,590
be released through the
material-- the capture

1030
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:10,350
material would be heated up.

1031
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:11,140
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

1032
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,610
Indeed.

1033
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,800
If the total Q value
is greater than zero,

1034
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,390
we refer to this as exothermic--

1035
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:20,960
kind of like in chemistry.

1036
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,550
And if Q is less than zero, we
refer to this as endothermic.

1037
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:30,298
So let's do our binding
energy subtraction now.

1038
00:50:30,298 --> 00:50:32,590
We want to figure out how
much excess binding energy is

1039
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:33,110
released.

1040
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:35,100
So I'm going to
take the reactants--

1041
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,850
I'm sorry-- I'm going
to take the product.

1042
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:47,110
So helium 295673--
add lithium 244526--

1043
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:53,560
subtract boron 0.7507-- subtract
the neutron, which is zero,

1044
00:50:53,560 --> 00:51:01,820
and we're left with 2.79 MeV.

1045
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:05,265
And because it's positive,
this is an exothermic reaction,

1046
00:51:05,265 --> 00:51:07,640
which is what we'd expect,
because this reaction actually

1047
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,050
happens.

1048
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:10,970
If this was an
endothermic reaction,

1049
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:12,660
what could you do
to make it occur?

1050
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:18,280
Yeah?

1051
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,248
AUDIENCE: Heat up the reactants.

1052
00:51:21,248 --> 00:51:22,790
MICHAEL SHORT: Like
with temperature,

1053
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:24,384
or what do you mean?

1054
00:51:24,384 --> 00:51:26,753
AUDIENCE: Make them have
higher kinetic energy or--

1055
00:51:26,753 --> 00:51:27,920
MICHAEL SHORT: There you go.

1056
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,378
So actually-- yeah-- you kind
of said the same thing twice.

1057
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,690
Heating things up does give
them higher kinetic energy.

1058
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,107
If you rely on
temperature, you'll

1059
00:51:34,107 --> 00:51:37,425
be imparting eV worth
of kinetic energy.

1060
00:51:37,425 --> 00:51:39,050
But if you accelerate
them, or get them

1061
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:40,467
from a different
nuclear reaction,

1062
00:51:40,467 --> 00:51:42,810
and you get them up
to the MeV level,

1063
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:45,590
where whatever this Q value
could be might be negative,

1064
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:47,760
then you can get the
reaction to occur.

1065
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:53,390
For example, what is
the Q of that reaction?

1066
00:51:56,708 --> 00:51:59,080
AUDIENCE: Negative 2.79.

1067
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,560
MICHAEL SHORT: Negative that.

1068
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,190
So in this case,
if you want lithium

1069
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:07,060
to absorb an alpha particle,
and make boron and a neutron,

1070
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:09,190
you would have to
accelerate the alphas

1071
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:12,850
to that same amount of energy
in order to get this to occur.

1072
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:16,600
So nuclear reactions do go
both ways, just not as easily.

1073
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,100
Kind of like chemical
reactions, you

1074
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,290
can drive them in
different directions

1075
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:22,690
by changing the temperature
or changing the concentration

1076
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:23,800
of the reactants.

1077
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,730
Here the concentration
doesn't matter.

1078
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:29,440
But the kinetic energy related
directly to the temperature

1079
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,710
definitely is.

1080
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:34,740
And so in this
case, it's 2.79 MeV.

1081
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:39,540
If I tell you the gamma ray
takes off 0.478 MeV of that,

1082
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:45,150
we're left with 2.31
MeV between the lithium

1083
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:48,120
nucleus and the helium nucleus.

1084
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,460
Now my next question-- my
last question for you today--

1085
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,100
oh man--

1086
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,542
is what's the split?

1087
00:52:53,542 --> 00:52:55,750
I think I don't want to keep
you longer, because it's

1088
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:56,973
one minute of 10:00.

1089
00:52:56,973 --> 00:52:58,390
So this is the
question that we're

1090
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,110
going to pick up
with on Thursday,

1091
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:03,190
which is how much of the
energy is taken off by helium?

1092
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:06,530
And how much is
taken off by lithium?

1093
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:09,640
Sorry, I should have kept
better track of the time.
