[EDIT: This is fixed in the next lecture.] The analytical solution of a differential equation of the kind y' + a*y = c*e^(-b*x), y(0)=y0 is of the kind y(t)=A*e^(-a*t)+B*e^(-b*t), with certain A and B, namely it is the sum of two exponentials decaying with different time constant. That can be easily verified, e.g. by typing y' + a*y = c*e^(-b*x), y(0)=1 at the webpage www.wolframalpha.com. The solution shown in the video seems then incomplete. Hope this comment is useful. By the way, the lecture is amazing, like the previous 9. Thank you very much!
