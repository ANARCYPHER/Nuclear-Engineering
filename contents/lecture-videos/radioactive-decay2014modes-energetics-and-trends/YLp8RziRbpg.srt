8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,490
MICHAEL SHORT: Today we
launch into radioactive decay.

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,580
And so this is kind of what
makes us, us in this field,

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,540
right?

11
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,880
Now that you've learned
the general cu equation

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,813
we're going to look at some
very simple, specific cases,

13
00:00:35,813 --> 00:00:37,730
and specifically all the
different things that

14
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,340
can come flying out of
nuclei and the orbiting

15
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,350
electrons around them.

16
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,110
First I'd like to try and
develop a generalized decay

17
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:46,610
diagram.

18
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,120
What are all the different
ways that nuclei can decay?

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,030
And I had written one of these
up to show on the slides,

20
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,118
and my one-year-old son fixed
it with a bunch of markers

21
00:00:57,118 --> 00:00:58,910
and crayons, so I think
we're going to have

22
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,065
to redo this from scratch.

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:09,360
So let's say you had a
generalized unstable nucleus

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,560
over here.

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,100
And we're going to start drawing
a generalized decay diagram.

26
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,170
You'll see decay diagrams,
well, much like these.

27
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,000
I've already shown
you a couple of these,

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,150
like these decay
diagrams for uranium 235,

29
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,420
soon as I clone my
screen so you can see it.

30
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,030
There are a couple
of axes that aren't

31
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,600
drawn on these
decay diagrams that

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,160
will help you interpret them.

33
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,110
And the first one,
the imaginary y-axis,

34
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,070
is in order of
increasing energy.

35
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,000
And the second imaginary
y-axis is z, atomic number.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,090
So this will help you
determine how we read these

37
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,135
and how to actually write them.

38
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:51,760
Now what are some of
the different ways

39
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,450
you've heard of things that
can radioactively decay,

40
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,080
or that you might have
read from the reading?

41
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,403
Just yell them out.

42
00:01:58,403 --> 00:01:59,320
AUDIENCE: Alpha decay.

43
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,445
MICHAEL SHORT: Alpha decay.

44
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:03,940
So in alpha decay,
what actually happens?

45
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,050
Let's say that we had a parent
nucleus with atomic number

46
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:12,318
z and mass number a.

47
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:13,360
What does it change into?

48
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,880
Anyone know what an alpha
particle consists of?

49
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,516
Yeah.

50
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:24,641
AUDIENCE: A helium nucleus.

51
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:26,310
MICHAEL SHORT: A helium nucleus.

52
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,780
So let's just say helium.

53
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,260
This will be a 4 and a 2.

54
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,480
and there's going to be
some daughter nucleus--

55
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,100
we don't know what--

56
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:40,700
with z minus 2 protons and
a minus 4 total nucleons.

57
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,440
So if we were to describe
alpha decay on a decay diagram,

58
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,850
where would we write the final
state of this alpha decayed

59
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,993
daughter nucleus?

60
00:02:50,993 --> 00:02:52,160
To the left or to the right?

61
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,163
I know it's like 9:00 AM, but
someone just shout it out.

62
00:03:01,163 --> 00:03:02,580
You don't have to
raise your hand.

63
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,260
AUDIENCE: To the left.

64
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:03,860
MICHAEL SHORT: To the left.

65
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,430
Yep.

66
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:09,110
Something that's decreasing in
z and also decreasing in energy,

67
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,870
we would draw an alpha
decay like this to the left.

68
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,680
So let's say this
would be something more

69
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,490
stable with a z minus 2--

70
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,180
make that clear--
and an a minus 4.

71
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,450
What are some other
ways things can decay?

72
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,200
I heard a whisper.

73
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,100
AUDIENCE: Beta.

74
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,550
MICHAEL SHORT: Beta decay.

75
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,270
So what happens in--

76
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,100
usually by beta
decay, we're referring

77
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,050
to beta minus decay,
which would be

78
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,350
the emission of an
electron from the nucleus.

79
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,050
Again, what's the
physical difference

80
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,690
between a beta particle
and an electron?

81
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,560
Nothing.

82
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,320
What's the nomenclature
difference?

83
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,977
The beta comes from the nucleus.

84
00:03:49,977 --> 00:03:51,560
Otherwise, when they
come out, they're

85
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,680
kind of indistinguishable.

86
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,120
So what happens in beta decay?

87
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,500
Let's say we have the same
parent nucleus starting with

88
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,070
z,a.

89
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:06,430
We know it emits an
electron with no mass.

90
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,145
And what else?

91
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,874
This is just a matter of
conservation of things here.

92
00:04:14,874 --> 00:04:16,170
AUDIENCE: Anti-neutrino.

93
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,350
MICHAEL SHORT: There
is an anti-neutrino

94
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,530
which has pretty close
to no mass and no charge.

95
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,960
And what about this
daughter nucleus?

96
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,040
How many protons and total
nucleons would it have?

97
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,317
Yeah.

98
00:04:32,317 --> 00:04:33,900
AUDIENCE: Should
have one more proton.

99
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,310
MICHAEL SHORT: Should
have one more proton

100
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,830
and how many more
total nucleons?

101
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,480
The same.

102
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,590
Yep, like that.

103
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,870
And so how would
we draw beta decay

104
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,603
on this generalized diagram,
to the left or to the right?

105
00:04:49,603 --> 00:04:50,270
AUDIENCE: Right.

106
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,437
MICHAEL SHORT: To the right.

107
00:04:51,437 --> 00:04:52,850
It's increasing in z.

108
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,920
I haven't defined any
scale, so let's just

109
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,170
say that's a change of 0.

110
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,060
That's 1.

111
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,660
That's 2.

112
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,460
And that's plus 1.

113
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,240
That's plus 2.

114
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,050
Hopefully we won't get to today.

115
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:14,240
So a beta decay
would proceed thusly.

116
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,010
So you'd have some other
stable nucleus with c

117
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,373
plus 1 and mass number 8.

118
00:05:22,373 --> 00:05:24,790
What are some other decays you
might have heard of before?

119
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:28,400
AUDIENCE: Electron capture.

120
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,960
MICHAEL SHORT: Electron capture.

121
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:36,350
So in electron capture,
what actually happens?

122
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,870
Start with the same
parent nucleus.

123
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,350
In this case, the nucleus
actually captures an electron

124
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,260
from one of the inner orbitals.

125
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,590
And so that, in effect, like,
neutralizes a proton, right,

126
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,917
in terms of charge.

127
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,000
So what do we end up with?

128
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,290
Yep.

129
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,920
So we'd have some
daughter nucleus.

130
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,140
If it neutralizes a proton,
we'd have one fewer protons.

131
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,515
And then how many
total nucleons?

132
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,030
The same.

133
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,920
Yep.

134
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,120
There we go.

135
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,270
And so if we were to draw
electron capture on this map,

136
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,230
we would have one fewer proton.

137
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:26,090
So we could have some sort
of decay by electron capture.

138
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,810
And anything else?

139
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,350
What other particles can
be emitted from a nucleus?

140
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,850
Yeah.

141
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,030
AUDIENCE: Positrons?

142
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,710
MICHAEL SHORT: Positrons.

143
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,150
So let's get this list going up.

144
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,940
So if we start off
with a parent, z and a,

145
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,850
we know we emit
a positron, which

146
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,220
is the anti-matter
equivalent of an electron.

147
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,580
So same general characteristics
except opposite charge.

148
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:04,500
In this case, we'll give it
a 0 protons and 0 neutrons.

149
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,415
And we end up with-- well,
the same daughter nucleus.

150
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,810
So we could say that this
precedes by positron creation

151
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,070
or electron capture.

152
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,340
It's the same process,
or the same ending state.

153
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:26,560
But can you have positrons
in any possible decay?

154
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,150
We actually went over this once.

155
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,090
Anyone remember?

156
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,632
Yeah, so you're
shaking your head no.

157
00:07:31,632 --> 00:07:33,465
AUDIENCE: You have to
have a certain energy,

158
00:07:33,465 --> 00:07:35,520
but I can't remember
what the energy is.

159
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,187
MICHAEL SHORT: We'll
get back into that.

160
00:07:37,187 --> 00:07:37,980
You're right.

161
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,840
So I'll put a little
box around this

162
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,030
because you have to have
a certain amount of energy

163
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,520
in order to create the positron.

164
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,160
And what else?

165
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,758
What about the easiest one?

166
00:07:48,758 --> 00:07:50,425
What else can be
emitted from a nucleus?

167
00:07:53,518 --> 00:07:54,450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

168
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,230
MICHAEL SHORT: I heard
a couple of things.

169
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,410
Neutrons.

170
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,830
So certainly if
you emit a neutron,

171
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,390
there are some very
unstable nuclei,

172
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,660
like helium 5, which
exists for what,

173
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,080
10 to the minus 26
seconds or something,

174
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,090
that could omit a neutron.

175
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,590
If we start off with
z and a, then we'll

176
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:18,400
start off with a
neutron and a daughter

177
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,183
with the same z and
a minus 1 total.

178
00:08:23,183 --> 00:08:25,100
So what would that look
like on a decay chain?

179
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,010
You don't usually see this,
but we'll draw it anyway.

180
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,922
It would go straight
down, right?

181
00:08:35,922 --> 00:08:37,339
So there'll be
some other nucleus.

182
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,649
So it'd be the same
z, but an a minus 1.

183
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,050
And it could decay
by neutron emission.

184
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,700
Yeah, that totally happens.

185
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,870
If you look at the
very, very right edge

186
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,090
of the table of nuclides--

187
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,370
let's go back to the
home page for that--

188
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,940
and look at the
super neutron rich.

189
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,960
Like helium 10.

190
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,210
Who's ever heard of this?

191
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,875
Doesn't even say, let's
say, two neutrons.

192
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,250
So this is so unstable that
it just immediately spits out

193
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:11,850
two neutrons.

194
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,260
So yeah, these things happen.

195
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,620
You won't tend to see this decay
in textbooks because it only

196
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,080
happens for exceptionally
unstable nuclei.

197
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,250
But yeah, that's true.

198
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,742
It does happen.

199
00:09:21,742 --> 00:09:22,700
What else could happen?

200
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,730
Remember we've been
talking about--

201
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,355
yeah.

202
00:09:28,355 --> 00:09:28,840
AUDIENCE: Gammas?

203
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,715
MICHAEL SHORT: Right.

204
00:09:29,715 --> 00:09:30,840
Could be gammas.

205
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,030
And so I'll make one
little extra piece

206
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,720
here for gamma decay, which
is nothing more than a photon

207
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,980
emitted from the nucleus.

208
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,960
We start off with
a parent z and a.

209
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,373
And this becomes-- well, what?

210
00:09:47,373 --> 00:09:48,915
Should I even write
daughter nucleus?

211
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,500
I see some people
shaking their heads no.

212
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,000
Why not?

213
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,165
Yeah?

214
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:00,040
AUDIENCE: You have
essentially the same atom.

215
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,582
It's just one of
its electrons should

216
00:10:01,582 --> 00:10:04,438
be at a lower energy state.

217
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:05,230
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

218
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:05,770
Very close.

219
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,340
You have the same atom, so
let's say the same parent,

220
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,440
with the same number of
protons, the same number

221
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,945
of total nucleons.

222
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,070
And I'll just correct that
to say one of its nuclei

223
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,630
is at a lower energy state.

224
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,340
But otherwise everything
is completely correct.

225
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,150
So why don't we put
a little star here

226
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,520
to say that that was
at an excited state?

227
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,610
Just like electrons can be
promoted to outer shells,

228
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,640
pick up a little bit of
energy, so can nucleons.

229
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,470
So can protons and neutrons.

230
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,540
And this is going to
be a subject of, well,

231
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,730
great discussion in 22.02.

232
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:40,570
For now all you have to know is
that nucleons, like electrons,

233
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,730
can occupy higher energy states.

234
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,710
And when they fall down
to lower energy states,

235
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:49,150
they can release that energy
in the form of a gamma ray.

236
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,010
So you could also
have, let's say,

237
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:56,470
squiggly line gamma decay
to something stable.

238
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,685
And so this right here would be
the generalized decay diagram.

239
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,090
Anyone ever heard
of one isotope that

240
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:10,700
undergoes all these
possible decay mechanisms?

241
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,760
Glad no one's saying anything,
because neither have I.

242
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,040
There's one that comes close.

243
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,477
Actually, if you look at--

244
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,310
no, that's not this
part I want to show you.

245
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,700
I want to show you the big one.

246
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,880
If you look at potassium
40, the nuclide we probably

247
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,310
talked about the most
so far, it covers

248
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,250
most of the space of this
generalized decay diagram.

249
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,550
And there was a question
that came through--

250
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,170
at least, I think for
non-anonymous email,

251
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,190
what is it that makes these
even, even versus odd,

252
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,460
odd nuclei less or more stable?

253
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,660
Anytime you have an odd,
odd nucleus, both the number

254
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,400
of protons and the
number of neutrons,

255
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,340
these nuclear shells
are not fully occupied

256
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,430
and they're not that stable
compared to an even, even

257
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,182
nucleus that has an even number
of z and an even number of n.

258
00:11:53,182 --> 00:11:54,890
Just kind of like
electrons, these things

259
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,600
tend to travel in pairs.

260
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,590
And not fully occupied energy
levels will be left stable.

261
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:05,090
Potassium 40 happens to be one
of those odd, odd nuclei that

262
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,550
is relatively unstable.

263
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,660
And it can go either way.

264
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,930
Either you can lose a proton
or you can gain a proton

265
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:15,950
by competing mechanisms
like positron or electron

266
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:20,110
capture or beta emission.

267
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,020
So this one I like a
lot because it gives you

268
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,720
almost every possible
decay with the exception

269
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,750
of alpha decay and
spontaneous neutron emission.

270
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,260
It's not that unstable.

271
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,250
Then the only one really missing
from here, I found what I think

272
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,220
is the simplest decay
diagram ever, dysprosium-151.

273
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,930
There's only one thing it can do
is it can decay by alpha decay

274
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,490
to its ground state.

275
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,830
I want to point out a few of
the features of these decay

276
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,830
diagrams so you know
what to look for.

277
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,630
Up here is the parent nucleus.

278
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,940
Down there is the
daughter nucleus.

279
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,930
And these energies
are not absolute.

280
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:58,060
They're relative to the ground
state of whatever the daughter

281
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,620
nucleus is.

282
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,030
So simple example helps show
you that gadolinium-147 doesn't

283
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,950
have a binding energy of 0.

284
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,760
This is relative to the ground
state of gadolinium-147.

285
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,760
And that will tell you that
the Q value for this reaction

286
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,720
is 4.1796 MeV.

287
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,470
These things are usually listed
in MeV unless said otherwise.

288
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,010
You also might notice a pattern
that most alpha particles

289
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:27,340
tend to come out
around 4 MeV or larger.

290
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,130
The answer to why is going
to be given in 22.02.

291
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,000
Yep.

292
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,975
AUDIENCE: Where do these
percentages come from?

293
00:13:32,975 --> 00:13:35,350
MICHAEL SHORT: These percentages
tell you the probability

294
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,720
that each decay will happen.

295
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,512
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

296
00:13:37,512 --> 00:13:39,573
Like how do we derive--

297
00:13:39,573 --> 00:13:40,615
how do we find those out?

298
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:42,115
MICHAEL SHORT: Ah,
these are usually

299
00:13:42,115 --> 00:13:44,170
measured because
it can be-- let's

300
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,510
say things get quantum
and difficult in terms

301
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,650
of calculating these.

302
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,540
And our knowledge
of wave functions

303
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,380
of, well, higher and
higher a or z nuclei

304
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,810
gets a little more tenuous.

305
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,310
So a lot of these
would be measured.

306
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,940
You can look at the number of
alpha particles of each energy

307
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,750
that you observe, and then you
get the average probabilities.

308
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,870
For this one, it's simple.

309
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,420
There's 100%
probability that this

310
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,250
is the only thing that exists.

311
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,500
The other things to
note, the half life

312
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,290
will be given up here, in
this case, at 17.9 minutes.

313
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:18,502
So relatively long half
life compared to helium 5.

314
00:14:18,502 --> 00:14:20,210
And we'll be going
over what half life is

315
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,210
and what they are on Friday.

316
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:25,150
And then the last thing
are the spin states

317
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,860
of the initial and
final nuclei, which

318
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,670
we will not cover in this class,
but you will cover in 22.02.

319
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,290
So don't worry about
those now, but do

320
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,990
know that when you need
to go find the spin

321
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,240
states of the initial
and final nuclei

322
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,880
to see if certain
transitions are allowed,

323
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,440
this is where
you're going to go.

324
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,350
Any questions on what you see
here on how to read these decay

325
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,850
diagrams?

326
00:14:48,565 --> 00:14:49,510
Cool.

327
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,050
OK.

328
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,510
Then let's move on to the
simplest of them, which,

329
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,763
in the table, can look
the most complicated.

330
00:14:55,763 --> 00:14:57,680
So here you can see that
there's a whole bunch

331
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,950
of different probabilities for
different alpha decay nuclei.

332
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,200
This is one of those more
complex examples where

333
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,600
the easiest thing to
do is just measure,

334
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,940
see how many alphas
you get at each energy,

335
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,430
and this will give you the
approximate probabilities

336
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,987
that each decay happens.

337
00:15:11,987 --> 00:15:13,820
And you'll notice here
that the final energy

338
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,140
states for each of these
alphas is not necessarily 0.

339
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,720
This will tell you what they
are relative to the ground state

340
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,110
of, in this case, thorium 231.

341
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:28,130
So you can emit an alpha
from any combination

342
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,530
of nuclear shell levels
inside this nucleus.

343
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,410
And you might end up
with a new daughter

344
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:37,648
nucleus whose protons or
neutrons are in excited states.

345
00:15:37,648 --> 00:15:39,440
And the way you remove
those excited states

346
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,760
is gamma decay, like
we talked about here.

347
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,670
So a lot of alpha
decays are immediately

348
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,600
followed by a chain
of gamma decays,

349
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,560
or what we call ITs, or
isometric transitions.

350
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,245
So you'll see a couple
bits of notation.

351
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,700
For example, gamma
decay, you may hear

352
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,333
it called isomeric transition.

353
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,750
We'll try to give them all so
that in the various readings

354
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,531
you have, you know what's what.

355
00:16:08,531 --> 00:16:11,730
So notice here, you can
have, with a probability

356
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,030
so small that they
didn't bother to draw it,

357
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:17,630
an alpha decay 2.634 MeV.

358
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,210
And then any series
of gammas from, let's

359
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,460
say, from this
state to that state,

360
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,610
and then from this
state to one of those

361
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,130
or one of those, and then
another one down there.

362
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,630
So an alpha decay
may be followed

363
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,860
by a whole bunch of gamma
transitions, or as few as none.

364
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,990
If you want to see what
the alpha energies are,

365
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,730
well, let's head to
the table of nuclides

366
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:46,800
and look at uranium 235.

367
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,210
So if we look up U 235,
you can see that it alpha

368
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,375
decays to thorium 231.

369
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,000
And I'll show you
the part of the table

370
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,150
that I didn't show you in
the slides, which is then

371
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:02,140
you've got a table of
alpha decay energies

372
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,410
as well as relative intensities
and what's called a hindrance.

373
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,990
This stuff right here
comes from the fact

374
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,450
that different
alpha decay energies

375
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,150
can happen with
different probabilities

376
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,810
at different times.

377
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,589
So the half life of a
particular alpha decay

378
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:18,819
can be slightly different.

379
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:22,210
And this is another one of
those really kooky things, where

380
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:26,079
certain energy alpha transitions
will happen a little more often

381
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,910
initially then finally.

382
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,700
But we don't have to
worry about that yet.

383
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,428
I just want you to know that's
why the hindrance is there.

384
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:33,970
And so you can look,
from this table,

385
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,600
what's the probability that each
of these alphas will come out.

386
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,070
And there's going to be
some uncertainty associated

387
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,570
with these.

388
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,737
This is going to usually
be some sort of measurement

389
00:17:42,737 --> 00:17:44,010
uncertainty.

390
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,110
Then you might
also ask, why is it

391
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,630
that the highest
energy alpha ray

392
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:55,210
is not the same
energy as the Q value?

393
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,920
So for this, it's a greatly
simplified application

394
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,272
of the Q equation that
we learned last time.

395
00:18:03,272 --> 00:18:05,230
So for here, what are
the two equations that we

396
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,440
need to conserve if we have
a system consisting of--

397
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,535
we have our initial nuclei
going into our final nuclei.

398
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:21,170
And they go off in equal
and opposite directions.

399
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:26,630
If it's alpha decay, then we
have no little initial nucleus.

400
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,650
We just had a large
initial nucleus at rest.

401
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:34,070
And afterwards, you've got
a small final nucleus, which

402
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,580
we know is the alpha particle,
and a large final nucleus,

403
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,620
which we'll call the
daughter product.

404
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,892
And let's say this
is the parent.

405
00:18:43,892 --> 00:18:46,100
It's a much, much simpler
system than the general one

406
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,600
we analyzed last week.

407
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,100
So what are the
equations that we'll

408
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,592
use to serve to find
out what's the energy

409
00:18:51,592 --> 00:18:52,550
of this alpha particle?

410
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:57,790
Anyone?

411
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,990
Same three answers as always.

412
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,798
Yep.

413
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:03,340
AUDIENCE: Mass,
energy, and momentum.

414
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,132
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

415
00:19:04,132 --> 00:19:07,645
Mass, energy, and momentum.

416
00:19:11,043 --> 00:19:13,210
I'm going to lump these two
together because they're

417
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,780
kind of the same thing.

418
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,420
So let's just go with
energy and momentum.

419
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,342
So what is the initial
kinetic energy, or let's say,

420
00:19:21,342 --> 00:19:23,050
the initial kinetic
energy of this parent

421
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,297
nucleus we can assume to be 0.

422
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,380
What about the final kinetic
energy of the system?

423
00:19:31,075 --> 00:19:32,450
Well, there's only
two particles.

424
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,560
There's going to be some kinetic
energy of the alpha particle

425
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,910
plus the recoil kinetic energy
because if the alpha goes

426
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,760
in one direction, the
daughter nucleus has to go off

427
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,020
in the other direction.

428
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:50,090
And the total energy
comes out to Q.

429
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,700
This Q value you can get
by conserving mass, where

430
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:58,620
we can say that the
mass of the parent

431
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,640
has to equal the
mass of the alpha

432
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,870
plus the mass of
the daughter plus Q.

433
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,570
So that's where we can get Q
if we don't know it already.

434
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:14,668
Luckily, we know it already.

435
00:20:14,668 --> 00:20:15,710
So there we've used mass.

436
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,180
There we've used energy.

437
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,080
And now what are the momenta
of the initial and final states

438
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,740
here?

439
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,010
Anyone?

440
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:22,760
Just shout it out.

441
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,956
What's the initial momentum
of the parent nucleus?

442
00:20:24,956 --> 00:20:25,690
AUDIENCE: 0.

443
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,245
MICHAEL SHORT: 0 equals--

444
00:20:28,245 --> 00:20:29,620
what's the momentum
of the alpha?

445
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,340
Anyone remember that
trick if we want to say p

446
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,110
equals mv equals what
more convenient form

447
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,430
that contains the energy?

448
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,540
Square root of 2 mt.

449
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,180
So let's go with that.

450
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,660
So there'll be the
square root of 2 mass

451
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,300
of the alpha, kinetic
energy of the alpha,

452
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,600
minus the square root
of 2 times the mass

453
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,020
of the daughter times the
kinetic energy of the daughter

454
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,840
because these have to have
equal and opposite momenta.

455
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,810
So all we have to do is
move that one over here.

456
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,140
This makes that equation easy.

457
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,960
Everything's got a
square root of 2.

458
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,235
We can square both sides.

459
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,400
And we end up with a
pretty simple relation,

460
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,560
mass of the alpha times the
kinetic energy of the alpha

461
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,230
is the mass of the daughter
times the kinetic energy

462
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,710
of the daughter.

463
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,930
We don't usually care
about the kinetic energy

464
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,045
of the recoil nucleus
or the daughter

465
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:41,920
because the range is so
small that we usually

466
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,030
don't get to measure it.

467
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,740
But we are trying
to measure what

468
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,650
are the actual alpha
particle energies so

469
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:55,270
that we can reconstruct
this table down here.

470
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,700
So we can take our energy
conservation equation

471
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,420
and rearrange it to isolate
td, the kinetic energy

472
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:08,360
of the daughter, and say
td equals Q minus t alpha.

473
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,730
Substitute that in here.

474
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,900
And let's rewrite
what we've got.

475
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,890
Mass of the alpha, t alpha,
equals mass of the daughter

476
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:24,660
times Q minus t alpha.

477
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:32,310
If we multiply each term in here
by md, we get mdQ minus md t

478
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,020
alpha.

479
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,960
Then we can take all of
the t alphas on one side.

480
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,940
So we'll just add md
t alpha to each side.

481
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,710
So we have m alpha
t alpha plus md t

482
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:55,870
alpha equals md Q. We can
factor out the t alpha here.

483
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:04,480
And then we can divide each
side by m alpha plus m daughter.

484
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,630
Cancel out the ma plus md.

485
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,830
And there we have the answer.

486
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,060
The kinetic energy
of the alpha is just

487
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,600
the q value times the
ratio of the daughter

488
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,820
mass to the total mass.

489
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,520
This should look
awfully familiar.

490
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,700
When we did this in the frame
of neutron elastic scattering

491
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,490
or any other reaction,
we had the same equation

492
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,410
with just different notation.

493
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,780
So do you guys
recognize this firm,

494
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:44,780
where we had t3 equals Q
times m4 over m3 plus m4.

495
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:48,560
It's the exact same result,
just different notation.

496
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,320
Last time we did it in the
most complex way possible.

497
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,080
This time we started off with
the simplest possible equations

498
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,430
for alpha decay.

499
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,645
In the end it's the
same Q equation.

500
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,020
We just didn't bother with
all the other terms and angles

501
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,270
and things that we don't need.

502
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:07,660
So is everyone clear
where this came from?

503
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,530
Cool.

504
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,570
And that's why
you're never going

505
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:13,000
to see an alpha
particle that's got

506
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,100
the same energy as the
initial minus the final energy

507
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,860
because the recoil nucleus,
or the daughter nucleus,

508
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,200
takes away some of
that kinetic energy

509
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,140
in order to conserve the
momentum of the system that

510
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,983
was initially at rest.

511
00:24:28,983 --> 00:24:30,400
Another way to say
this, for those

512
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,900
who like center of
mass coordinates,

513
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,420
is the center of
mass of this system

514
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,340
was just the parent nucleus.

515
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,870
It was at rest.

516
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:40,570
The center of mass of the final
system has to remain at rest

517
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,370
to conserve momentum.

518
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,890
But again, I won't go
much into center of mass

519
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,230
because I find it a
little unintuitive.

520
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,240
I'll stick with a laboratory
frame of reference.

521
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,650
So any questions
before I move on?

522
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,170
Alpha, I think, is the simplest
case of radioactive decay.

523
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:01,060
And I think now you know all
you need to know about it.

524
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,230
Yes.

525
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,390
AUDIENCE: So why do you
get so many different types

526
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,300
if we just calculated it?

527
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:11,770
Like mb, in mass
[INAUDIBLE] change?

528
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,960
MICHAEL SHORT: Not ma and md.

529
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,490
But ta and td would change.

530
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:18,990
Yep.

531
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,750
So in this case, for
different alpha decays,

532
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,760
they'll have different Q values.

533
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,730
So the Q value of, let's
say, this top alpha decay

534
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:32,430
is this energy here,
4.676 MeV minus 0.634.

535
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:38,245
So use a different Q and you'll
get different ta's and td's.

536
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:38,870
So don't worry.

537
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,960
You'll get chances to try
out these calculations

538
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,460
on the homework,
where I'll actually

539
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:46,990
ask you to calculate some
of these from this equation,

540
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:50,990
make sure you get the
same values as the table.

541
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:55,060
Any other questions on alpha
decay before moving on to beta?

542
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,540
Just going in order
of the Greek alphabet.

543
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,640
So beta decay is a
kind of funny one.

544
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,940
You don't tend to get
a beta particle out

545
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,520
at the energy of this Q value.

546
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,650
You actually end up
getting a spectrum.

547
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:15,020
And this measured spectrum of
different beta kinetic energies

548
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,940
is what led to the
thoughts that there

549
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,360
must be something else carrying
away some of that extra mass

550
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,880
or some of that extra energy.

551
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,710
I say that like it's the same
thing because it totally is.

552
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,750
And this is what
led to the thinking

553
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,810
that there's got to be some
other very difficult to detect

554
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:30,320
particle.

555
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,480
So the theorists
here we're saying,

556
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,520
if we know the initial and
final energies from beta decay,

557
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,430
and we know that we get a
spectrum of different beta

558
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,680
energies and the
probability of finding

559
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,640
a beta particle at energy
Q drops to, like, 0,

560
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,140
you'll almost never see it.

561
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,300
There's got to be something
else carrying away the energy.

562
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,370
So this idea of the
neutrino, or in this case,

563
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,340
the anti-neutrino, was
proposed a long time

564
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,590
before it was confirmed.

565
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,575
And finally we know why.

566
00:26:59,575 --> 00:27:01,700
And one of the questions
I want you to think about,

567
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,330
because it might be on an
exam in exactly two weeks,

568
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:09,560
is if this is the relative
number of electrons

569
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,270
from beta decay as a
function of energy,

570
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,660
what does the number of
anti-neutrinos versus energy

571
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,328
look like in order to maintain
conservation of energy?

572
00:27:18,328 --> 00:27:20,370
So it's something I want
you guys to think about,

573
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,787
but I'm not going
to tell you what

574
00:27:21,787 --> 00:27:24,900
it is until the
solutions for an exam.

575
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,180
In the meantime,
another thing to note

576
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,670
is that these beta
decays can also

577
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,410
be followed by any number
of gamma transitions.

578
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,170
I've given you a simple one.

579
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:37,020
If you want to look up simple
ones to test your knowledge,

580
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,880
go with the light elements.

581
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,530
They don't have
that many nucleons

582
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,110
and they won't have
that many transitions.

583
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:47,690
For example, if we pick
a beta decay nucleus,

584
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:50,150
something simple.

585
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:53,430
Let's go with lithium,
which typically has--

586
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,920
the stable isotopes are
lithium 6 or lithium 7.

587
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,470
So do you think
that higher or lower

588
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:03,608
mass number lithium will
tend to go by beta decay

589
00:28:03,608 --> 00:28:05,275
based on this generalized
decay diagram?

590
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,920
It's what?

591
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,245
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

592
00:28:12,245 --> 00:28:13,120
MICHAEL SHORT: Lower.

593
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,175
Lower proton number?

594
00:28:14,175 --> 00:28:16,300
Well, we've got to stick
with the number of protons

595
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,370
because we need
to remain lithium.

596
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,120
So in other words, do
you expect lithium 4

597
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,880
and lithium 5 or lithium 8 and
lithium 9 to go by beta decay?

598
00:28:30,577 --> 00:28:31,660
AUDIENCE: The higher ones.

599
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,400
MICHAEL SHORT: The higher ones.

600
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:32,995
OK.

601
00:28:32,995 --> 00:28:34,620
If you guys remember
the mass parabolas

602
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,720
from a couple of weeks
ago, we delineated

603
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:43,920
where you'd expect
beta decay in order

604
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,808
to increase the proton number.

605
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:47,850
So if you've got too many
neutrons and not enough

606
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:51,690
protons, chances are beta decay
will help equalize you out.

607
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,470
So as a guess--

608
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,550
I haven't even
tried this at home.

609
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,057
Let's see.

610
00:28:54,057 --> 00:28:55,640
Let's see what happens
with lithium 8.

611
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,860
Oh, look at that.

612
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,740
Beta decay.

613
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,020
It can also decay by
beta plus 2 alpha,

614
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,330
which is another word for
the nucleus just blows apart.

615
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:08,570
It's interesting, too, if you
read Chadwick's paper again,

616
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:12,350
the way he described a
beryllium nucleus is consisting

617
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:16,010
of a neutron plus
two alpha particles.

618
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,630
Interesting, huh?

619
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,100
Lithium 9 could decay
by--or let's say lithium 8.

620
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,380
What do we have?

621
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,510
Beta plus 2 alpha.

622
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,240
Yeah.

623
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,490
So Chadwick
described any nucleus

624
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:28,400
as consisting of these
elementary-ish particles

625
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,780
that you could measure.

626
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,150
And in this case, you kind
of see a physical example.

627
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,830
When this nucleus
blows apart, it just

628
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,780
becomes two alphas in a beta.

629
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,790
Interesting.

630
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:40,340
But let's look at the
beta decay to beryllium 8.

631
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,040
Pretty simple.

632
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,970
You may ask why can't you
have beta decay directly

633
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:49,530
from the highest energy to
the ground state energy?

634
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,700
That is a 22.02 question
that I'll mention.

635
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:56,410
There are allowed and unaligned
transitions between spins

636
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,650
and energy states.

637
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:01,060
So if you're wondering why
isn't every line drawn,

638
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,800
in the case of really
complex nuclei,

639
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,350
there aren't enough pixels
on the screen sometimes.

640
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,690
But for the simple
nuclei, there are actually

641
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,580
rules of selection
to decide when

642
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,158
you can make this transition.

643
00:30:11,158 --> 00:30:12,700
But a lot of beta
decays will usually

644
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,370
be something like a beta
decay followed by a gamma.

645
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:21,160
So let's see a couple
of well-known examples.

646
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,450
For example, carbon-14.

647
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,180
This is the basis behind
carbon dating, one

648
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:28,907
of those rare instances when
you have a beta decay directly

649
00:30:28,907 --> 00:30:29,740
to the ground state.

650
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,930
It's about as simple as it gets.

651
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:35,890
And because the half
life is 5,730 years,

652
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:38,110
it's really useful
for dating when

653
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,270
did an organism or
piece of material

654
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:44,320
die on the timescale of, let's
say, tens to tens of thousands

655
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,550
of years.

656
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,310
Once you've gone
past a few half lives

657
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,695
and there's very
little carbon-14 left,

658
00:30:49,695 --> 00:30:51,070
there aren't a
lot of decays left

659
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,260
and your counting
statistics get crappy,

660
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,960
and it gets harder and
harder to carbon date things.

661
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,200
The basis behind this is that
all living organisms that

662
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,770
are intaking and exhaling
carbon by some means

663
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:06,430
remain in isotopic equilibrium
with the carbon surrounding

664
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,330
them.

665
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:10,390
And while most carbon is
CO2, and food and whatever

666
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,490
is carbon-12,
you're going to have

667
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:15,880
a little bit of
carbon-14 production

668
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,110
from the upper atmosphere.

669
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,850
This is usually a
cosmic ray phenomenon,

670
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:21,880
which we'll get into when
we get into cosmic rays.

671
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,150
The moment you die you
stop intaking carbon,

672
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:28,270
and the little bit of carbon-14
in the cloth and the food

673
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,970
and your body, whatever,
starts to decay naturally

674
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,840
with a very regular decay curve.

675
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,257
And so this is the whole
basis behind carbon dating.

676
00:31:36,257 --> 00:31:37,840
And in the next
p-set, you'll actually

677
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,560
see how this was used to
debunk the Shroud of Turin,

678
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,320
or the supposed burial
cloth of Jesus of Nazareth,

679
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,250
because the carbon dating
data just didn't check out.

680
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:50,920
As much as people really wanted
to feel like we found it, no.

681
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,060
Science.

682
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,900
That's the answer.

683
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,970
No.

684
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,640
Another well-known one
we've talked about before

685
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:02,950
is molybdenum 99 decaying to
technetium 99 meta stable.

686
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,660
Notice how here,
any number of beta

687
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:08,890
decays and any cascade of
very fast gamma transitions,

688
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:13,738
they almost all end right
here at this state of about--

689
00:32:13,738 --> 00:32:16,030
let's see, there's two numbers
written over each other.

690
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:20,230
But it's about 140
keV or 0.14 MeV.

691
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,720
This transition from this
state to the ground state

692
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,390
is a slow transition.

693
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:26,890
So you can actually
build up technitum 99

694
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,870
in what's called
series decay, which

695
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,790
we're going to cover on Friday.

696
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:34,780
And then you can use
these 140 KeV gamma

697
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,878
rays to do medical imaging.

698
00:32:36,878 --> 00:32:38,920
So when you get a medical
imaging procedure done,

699
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,830
chances are this
is how it's done.

700
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:46,720
You get moly 99 out of a
reactor or an accelerator,

701
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,420
chemically isolate
the technetium 99 meta

702
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,970
stable, which lasts on
the order of six days

703
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,180
or so, very quickly get
it to someone, inject it,

704
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,110
and image where do
the gamma rays go,

705
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:00,840
or where do the
gamma rays come from?

706
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,950
One last notable one is
responsible for a lot of, well,

707
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,320
problems when folks
go urban exploring

708
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,480
in old dentist's offices.

709
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,040
Nowadays they have
electrostatic x-ray machines

710
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,030
at dentist's offices.

711
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,460
But back in the day, you
could get a little button

712
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:21,420
of cobalt 60, which would emit
two very characteristic gamma

713
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,460
rays in addition
to its beta decays.

714
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:28,020
So normally what happens
is cobalt 60 decays quickly

715
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,760
to an excited
state and gives off

716
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,400
two gamma rays in
succession, which

717
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,490
would be used for imaging.

718
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:36,073
Problem is that's
the a cobalt source.

719
00:33:36,073 --> 00:33:38,323
And if you don't know what
it is, and you're like, oh,

720
00:33:38,323 --> 00:33:41,660
cool, what's this blue thing, I
think I'll put it in my pocket

721
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,560
and keep it--

722
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,860
that has been responsible
for some injuries

723
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,942
from some folks that
didn't know any better.

724
00:33:48,942 --> 00:33:50,650
And then how do you
detect the neutrinos?

725
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:53,810
We talked about the theoretical
reason why they exist.

726
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,660
Let's actually see
how they're measured.

727
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,790
There is a hollowed
out salt mine

728
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:01,270
of some sort called
Kamiokande in Japan.

729
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:05,680
It's a humongous hole in the
ground filled with water,

730
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,820
for a reason, and lined
with tens of thousands

731
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,219
of highly sensitive photo
tubes that can pick up

732
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:14,500
tiny, tiny amounts of light.

733
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,750
The reason for this
is because neutrinos,

734
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,030
as you saw in problem
set 1, are always

735
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:22,060
traveling near the speed
of light in a vacuum.

736
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:26,020
So if the speed of
light in a vacuum,

737
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:31,989
let's call that 1, and the
velocity of the neutrino--

738
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:33,379
wasn't it something like 9.

739
00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:36,250
999c or something like that?

740
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,880
It was pretty high.

741
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,770
The speed of light and
water is significantly less

742
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,989
than the speed of
light in a vacuum.

743
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:46,780
When you have a material or
a particle that goes faster

744
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:50,693
than the speed of light in the
medium that it's traveling in,

745
00:34:50,693 --> 00:34:52,110
then you can produce
what's called

746
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,710
Cherenkov radiation,
which I think

747
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,489
I've mentioned once before.

748
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:57,850
It's kind of like a
sonic boom in that you

749
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:01,450
get a conical shockwave
of energy radiated

750
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:04,000
from that particle that tells
you which direction it's

751
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,990
coming from.

752
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,300
But instead of a sound
wave, you get light.

753
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,920
And this whole
detector is designed

754
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,670
to look at the ellipses of
Cherenkov radiation released

755
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:15,920
by neutrinos and anti-neutrinos.

756
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,550
So what happens is
if a neutrino happens

757
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:22,180
to interact with the water here,
it produces Cherenkov radiation

758
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,460
lighting up a ring
of these detectors

759
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,320
so you can tell
it's energy and you

760
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,460
can tell where it came from.

761
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,520
So if you, let's
say, can correlate

762
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,930
a supernova or some sort
of crazy galactic whatever

763
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:37,510
with a slight
burst of neutrinos,

764
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:41,290
then you've got a pretty
significant astronomical event.

765
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,270
It also led to my
favorite BBC headline

766
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:47,760
ever, "Particle physics
telescope explodes."

767
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,720
You'd see this on, like,
Fox News or something.

768
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,450
No, this was the BBC.

769
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:54,060
What happened here is
one of these 30,000

770
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,580
or so tubes was
slightly defective,

771
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,570
couldn't hold the
pressure, and it burst.

772
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:02,220
And the resulting
sound shock wave

773
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:06,640
from one photo tube bursting
blew up about 11,000 of them.

774
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,940
So yeah, the particle physics
telescope kind of did explode.

775
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:13,480
They did rebuild it
and it's still going.

776
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,690
It was an expensive repair
because all 11,300 something

777
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:20,830
tubes had to be rebuilt.
And if you notice,

778
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,270
there's a guy on a boat there.

779
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,500
How do you install them?

780
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,400
Well, you float
on a boat quietly,

781
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,060
and put the photo tubes in,
and raise the water level,

782
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,670
and float to another
part of the detector

783
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:36,820
quietly, and continue
installing the photo tubes

784
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,860
until you're done.

785
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,807
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

786
00:36:38,807 --> 00:36:39,640
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

787
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,070
You don't.

788
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,000
Yeah.

789
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,790
Don't sneeze.

790
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,480
So yeah.

791
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,600
Favorite BBC headline ever.

792
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,140
Thanks again, science.

793
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,750
For positron decay--

794
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,560
OK, we've got about
10 minutes left--

795
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,010
for positron decay,
this is the energy

796
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,760
that you need in order
to make a positron.

797
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,840
It is approximately exactly
double the [INAUDIBLE] rest

798
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,360
mass of an electron.

799
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,010
And the question usually
comes up, well, a positron

800
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:08,370
has a rest mass
energy of 0.511 MeV.

801
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,660
Why do you need double
that to make the positron?

802
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,910
Because in order to conserve
the charge of the system,

803
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:15,180
you have to shed an
orbital electron.

804
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,540
So the system has got to be
able to lose two electrons

805
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,160
in the process, one
positively charged

806
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,870
and one negatively charged.

807
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:25,740
And so that's why the
Q for positron decay

808
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,240
is just going to be--

809
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,640
remember, this symbol's
the excess mass here,

810
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,310
excess mass of the parent minus
excess mass of the daughter

811
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:36,570
minus 2 times the rest mass
of the electron squared.

812
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:41,990
To refresh your memories a
bit, find some empty space.

813
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:44,420
The excess mass is
nothing more than the mass

814
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:48,730
minus the horrible
approximation of the mass.

815
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:52,040
So the excess mass and the
real mass are directly related.

816
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,430
And these are things
that you can look up.

817
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,260
Just to remind you
guys that excess mass

818
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,390
and mass and binding
energy and kinetic energy

819
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,500
are all related, again,
by the Q equation.

820
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,792
It's probably the last time
I'll say it because I think

821
00:38:03,792 --> 00:38:07,290
that's about 100, by my count.

822
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,810
Positrons can be used for
some pretty awesome things.

823
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:12,000
And in the last
five minutes or so,

824
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,190
I want to show you some
work done by Professor Brian

825
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,360
Wirth at the University
of Tennessee,

826
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,010
Knoxville on positron
annihilation spectroscopy,

827
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:22,500
using anti-matter
to probe matter

828
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,030
and find out what
sort of defects exist.

829
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,970
And as a nuclear
material scientist,

830
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:30,270
I'd be, well, terrible
if I didn't inject

831
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,400
a little bit of
materials and how

832
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,040
we use nuclear stuff in 22.01
in order to probe that thing.

833
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,140
So the way that positron
annihilation spectroscopy works

834
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,630
is that, well, matter's
mostly empty space.

835
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:45,570
And then in a regular
crystal lattice,

836
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:52,000
where the atoms are arranged
in a very regular array,

837
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,110
let's say these atoms have
their orbital electrons.

838
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:59,950
The empty space between
is also arranged

839
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,810
in a very regular array.

840
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:05,440
And positrons annihilate
with electrons to produce--

841
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,090
well, we'll find
out in a second.

842
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,070
But where in matter
would they want to live,

843
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,420
or where would they last longer?

844
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,580
Not near an atom, but
near the space in between.

845
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:16,930
So you can map out the
empty spaces in matter

846
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:19,900
in a regular crystal and
calculate an average positron

847
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,920
lifetime.

848
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,600
If you were to fire a
positron into this matter,

849
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,270
how long would it
sit and bounce around

850
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:31,090
before colliding
with an electron

851
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:34,840
and releasing that
extra rest mass energy?

852
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,930
It turns out if you have
crystalline defects,

853
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:39,810
the positrons tend to
last a little longer.

854
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,950
There's a little
more empty space,

855
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:44,820
which is to say there are
more places with a slightly

856
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,920
less probability of
finding an electron.

857
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,410
And so they last longer.

858
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:52,778
And you can measure the
lifetime of positrons

859
00:39:52,778 --> 00:39:55,320
before they enter the material,
and then how long before they

860
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,800
produce their characteristic
destruction gamma rays.

861
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:04,020
So if you think about it,
you have a positron coming in

862
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:10,800
with a rest mass 0.511 MeV.

863
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,100
And it collides with an electron
from some orbital nucleus that

864
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,320
has the same rest mass.

865
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,080
The positron and the electron
annihilate sending off

866
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,300
gamma rays in opposite
directions, where

867
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:31,062
the energy of this gamma
is same thing, 0.511 MV.

868
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:32,520
So you can tell
when a positron was

869
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,450
destroyed because you instantly
get 1/2 a MeV gamma ray.

870
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:39,420
Or actually, you get
two 1/2 MeV gamma rays.

871
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,560
Then the question is, how
do you tell its lifetime?

872
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,920
Let's go back to something
that I didn't quite point out,

873
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,310
but I want to show you
now, is this positron decay

874
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:54,480
is immediately followed
by a 1.27 MeV gamma

875
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,690
ray, which in PAS, or Positron
Annihilation Spectroscopy,

876
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,540
we call this the
birth gamma ray.

877
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:05,790
This gamma ray is emitted the
instant this nucleus is born.

878
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:09,727
And the positron takes a little
bit of time to get destroyed.

879
00:41:09,727 --> 00:41:11,310
So you actually look
at the difference

880
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:20,080
in time between sensing the 1.27
MeV gamma ray and the 0.511 MeV

881
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,952
annihilation photons.

882
00:41:21,952 --> 00:41:23,410
And that is measured
in, let's say,

883
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:25,300
hundreds of pico
seconds with resolution

884
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,310
of around 5 picoseconds.

885
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:31,000
And you can then tell, from the
lifetime and how many survive,

886
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,595
what sort of atomic defects
might exist in the material.

887
00:41:35,595 --> 00:41:37,720
So if you want to count
the number of missing atoms

888
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,840
or vacancies in
a material, which

889
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,270
is extremely important to those
of us in radiation damage,

890
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:47,300
you can do so with positron
annihilation spectroscopy.

891
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,550
So I think I wanted to show
you a little bit about how

892
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,270
this works.

893
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:55,050
You start off by making a
radioactive salt sandwich.

894
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:58,110
You take some sodium
chloride, specifically

895
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:02,820
of the isotope sodium 22,
which is giving off positrons

896
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,900
all the time.

897
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,230
And you sandwich that
radioactive jelly

898
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:10,320
between the two slices of bread,
better known as your sample.

899
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,060
That way you catch
every positron

900
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:15,710
that gets out so you don't
lose half of them to one side.

901
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:19,320
You've got two detectors
on either side waiting.

902
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,228
So there's some probability
that the photons emitted

903
00:42:22,228 --> 00:42:24,270
are going to go in the
direction of the detector.

904
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:27,360
So you miss most of the
signal, but so what?

905
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:32,100
Whenever you actually sense
a 1.27 MeV gamma ray followed

906
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:35,580
by two 511 KeVs
here, then you know

907
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,860
you've had a positron
annihilation event,

908
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:41,160
and you can actually count
the time between when

909
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,390
those things happened.

910
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:43,890
And you can see the
number of counts

911
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:45,930
and get the average
positron lifetime

912
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:49,170
from finding out how many
counts you get every five pico

913
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,280
seconds, for example.

914
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,610
There's something to note
about these counting spectra.

915
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:56,610
Anybody know why they're
so smooth up here

916
00:42:56,610 --> 00:43:02,540
and then they're so
delineated down here?

917
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,998
Anyone have an idea?

918
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,550
You're going to see this a lot
in 22.09, when you actually

919
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:12,460
count theta particles or alpha
particles and your counting

920
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,650
statistics get a
little crappier.

921
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:16,930
This is a log scale of
counts, or in this case,

922
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:19,780
counts per five pico seconds.

923
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,090
10 to the 0's better known as 1.

924
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:25,120
So you're looking at one
count or two or three.

925
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,690
You're looking at
the discrete event.

926
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,630
You can't have one
and 1/2 counts.

927
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:30,910
So you're going to
see this kind of thing

928
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:33,700
quite a lot when you're trying
to count very rare events.

929
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,640
And if you're down in
the weeds like this,

930
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,070
let's just say your
statistics aren't that good.

931
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:41,890
But since this is a logarithmic
scale, 10 to the 4th

932
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:43,780
is better known
as 10,000, that's

933
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,910
enough to get good
statistics and fit

934
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:49,600
a nice curve to this
positron lifetime thing.

935
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,000
This is what one of them
actually looks like.

936
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,058
And you can kind of tell.

937
00:43:55,058 --> 00:43:57,350
Inside there is where all
the positrons are coming out.

938
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:59,410
So that's probably
lead shielding.

939
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:01,660
Here's two detectors
on either side.

940
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:05,960
And here's another detector
to detect that 1.27 MeV birth

941
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:06,813
gamma ray.

942
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:08,730
So if you get those three
events happening all

943
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,480
at the right time, you've
got a positive event

944
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,272
that you can count.

945
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,920
And last thing I'll mention
is you can actually use this,

946
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,380
like I said, to gut not just
the number of vacancies,

947
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:23,050
but the number of
different size defects.

948
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:24,970
You might have two or
three missing atoms next

949
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:28,140
to each other, which will have
different positron lifetimes.

950
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:31,780
And you can actually count
the number of each of these

951
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:35,322
to get the diameter or the
size of these atomic defects.

952
00:44:35,322 --> 00:44:37,030
And this is one of
the ways of confirming

953
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:40,630
our models of radiation damage,
which is, like, all I do.

954
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:42,785
That's half of our group.

955
00:44:42,785 --> 00:44:44,160
If you want to
read anything more

956
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,800
about positron
annihilation spectroscopy,

957
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,665
all the stuff in
these slides were

958
00:44:48,665 --> 00:44:50,790
from these references,
which you can look up easily

959
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:52,440
on the MIT libraries.

960
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,750
We have access to everything
because that's MIT.

961
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,705
We just buy everything there is.

962
00:44:56,705 --> 00:44:58,080
So I'd encourage
you to look here

963
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,750
if you want to see more
details on how this works

964
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,450
and why it works.

965
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:06,140
So because it's exactly
five of five of,

966
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,930
I want to open it up to any
questions on alpha decay,

967
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:12,065
beta decay, positron decay,
or the decay diagrams

968
00:45:12,065 --> 00:45:13,190
that we've developed today.

969
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:19,360
Yes.

970
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,540
AUDIENCE: What is the most
dangerous kind of decay?

971
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,457
MICHAEL SHORT: What is
the most dangerous kind

972
00:45:23,457 --> 00:45:25,320
of decay to be exposed to?

973
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,640
So in this case, you'd want to
say the energy of the particle

974
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,440
is held constant, and the
number of those particles

975
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,150
is held constant.

976
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:35,643
And actually, we're going
to answer this question

977
00:45:35,643 --> 00:45:37,560
when we get to medical
and biological effects.

978
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,163
But let's do a little
flash word now.

979
00:45:39,163 --> 00:45:41,580
Let's assume, if you want to
see which one of these decays

980
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,610
is most dangerous, we'll
have to say constant--

981
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:54,010
constant-- energy of decay,
constant activity, and what

982
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:56,850
else can we hold constant?

983
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:59,070
Well, constant you.

984
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:02,360
Let's say the same number of
particles end up hitting you.

985
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:07,080
That depends on whether they're
inside or outside your body.

986
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,680
If you were to ingest
material, then alphas

987
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,200
would be your worst
because alpha particles

988
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,650
are massive and
charged nuclei, which

989
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,630
means they interact very
strongly with matter

990
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:19,210
around them.

991
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,182
So if you ingest
them and they end up

992
00:46:21,182 --> 00:46:23,640
incorporating into your cells,
where they can just get next

993
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,580
to DNA, they can
just blast it apart.

994
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:29,460
However, an alpha source
of equal strength held

995
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,920
in your hand would do nothing.

996
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,142
The dead skin cells are enough
to stop alpha particles.

997
00:46:35,142 --> 00:46:36,600
And we're going to
find out exactly

998
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,850
why when we look at
the range and stopping

999
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:41,540
power of different
particles and matter.

1000
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,950
From the outside, alphas won't
really get through your skin.

1001
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:48,110
Betas might get through a little
bit of your skin, but not much.

1002
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:50,660
Gamma rays will mostly
go right through you.

1003
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:54,650
It's neutrons that
are the real killers.

1004
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:58,190
Those neutrons are
heavy but uncharged.

1005
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,380
So they interact
kind of strongly.

1006
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,590
When they do hit,
they pack a wallop

1007
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:04,130
and they do a lot of damage.

1008
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:05,900
And they're mean
free path, and you is

1009
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,920
on the order of 10 centimeters.

1010
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,030
So a neutron source from the
outside can do a lot of damage

1011
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:12,112
from the outside.

1012
00:47:12,112 --> 00:47:13,820
The alphas and the
betas would be stopped

1013
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:15,530
by your skin and clothes.

1014
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:18,072
The gamma rays, almost all of
them will go right through you.

1015
00:47:18,072 --> 00:47:20,322
And you guys will actually
have to do this calculation

1016
00:47:20,322 --> 00:47:22,010
to find out how many
gamma rays would

1017
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:23,803
you absorb from a
gamma ray emission,

1018
00:47:23,803 --> 00:47:25,220
and how many go
right through you.

1019
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:28,760
The hint is most
of them get out.

1020
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,590
So there's an exam
question we used

1021
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:33,080
to ask in 22.01 that I was
asked during the first exam,

1022
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:37,340
is you've got four cookies, an
alpha emitter, a beta emitter,

1023
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:41,690
a gamma emitter, and a neutron
emitter of constant energy

1024
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:42,890
and activity.

1025
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:44,940
You must do one
of the following.

1026
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:48,320
You have to hold one in
your hand at arm's length.

1027
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,270
You have to put
one in your pocket.

1028
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:55,400
You have to eat one, and you
have to give one to a friend.

1029
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,582
What do you do and why?

1030
00:47:58,582 --> 00:48:00,025
Anyone have an idea?

1031
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:03,940
Pop quiz.

1032
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:05,220
Yeah?

1033
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:08,323
AUDIENCE: Probably give the
neutron one to a friend.

1034
00:48:08,323 --> 00:48:09,490
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

1035
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:11,198
I can tell this is
the west, because when

1036
00:48:11,198 --> 00:48:14,680
I asked a group of Singaporean
students the same question,

1037
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,560
they would eat the neutron
to save the friend because

1038
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,150
of Confucian ethics.

1039
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:21,190
Yeah, it doesn't fly here.

1040
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:24,717
Your answer is correct
because this is America.

1041
00:48:24,717 --> 00:48:26,342
What would you do
with the other three?

1042
00:48:26,342 --> 00:48:27,580
AUDIENCE: Eat the gamma.

1043
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:29,872
MICHAEL SHORT: Eat the gamma
because most of the gammas

1044
00:48:29,872 --> 00:48:32,590
will just get to
the friend, right?

1045
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:35,560
What about the
alpha and the beta?

1046
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:41,807
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1047
00:48:41,807 --> 00:48:42,640
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

1048
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,515
Hold the beta at arm's
length because there's

1049
00:48:44,515 --> 00:48:47,320
another aspect of shielding
betas that we'll get into.

1050
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,240
When betas stop
in material, they

1051
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,013
produce some low energy
x-rays called bremsstrahlung.

1052
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:53,680
So you'd want to get
those far from you.

1053
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,600
And the alpha in
your pocket will just

1054
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,920
be absorbed by the pocket.

1055
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,640
Yeah, so that's
the right question.

1056
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,130
So you're not going to
see that on the exam.

1057
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:03,530
But good news is you pretty
much got the right answer

1058
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:06,080
because this is America.

1059
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,600
Probably time for one more
question if anyone has one.

1060
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:13,010
Cool.

1061
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:15,240
If not, then I
want to remind you

1062
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,770
Amelia will see you on Thursday,
so do come to class Thursday.

1063
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:21,950
I'm going to change the
syllabus to reflect that.

1064
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:24,230
And we'll have two
hours of class on Friday

1065
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:27,260
to get through decay and
activity and half life,

1066
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:30,140
followed by an
hour of recitation.

1067
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,373
So I will see you
guys Friday, and we'll

1068
00:49:32,373 --> 00:49:34,790
see what mood I'm in depending
on how the nano calorimetry

1069
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:37,220
goes.

1070
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,900
Could be a fun measurement.
