00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,430
MICHAEL SHORT: Today I want
to pick up where we left off--

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,770
well, to remind you where
we left off last time,

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,520
we were watching videos
of crushing things

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,610
with the explicit purpose
of understanding material

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,422
properties, so that we can talk
a little bit about radiation

13
00:00:38,422 --> 00:00:39,630
damage and nuclear materials.

14
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,980
Since I got more than
a few requests to say,

15
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,040
what's all this
nuclear materials?

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,440
It's like the biggest research
field in the department,

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,450
and yet, it's not
talked about in 22.01.

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,830
Well, now it is.

19
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,800
So we talked before about
all the different stages

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,370
in radiation damage from
creation of single defects

21
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,360
to their clustering into
things like voids or loops

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,550
and super structures
that have end up

23
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,010
having macroscopic effects
on material properties,

24
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,920
and all of them is due to
the production of crystal

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,610
and defects due to radiation.

26
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,290
And to refresh your
memory quickly,

27
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,350
I'm going to jump ahead
to the stress strain curve

28
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,440
that we were looking at before
we started watching videos

29
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,925
of crushing things,
to remind you

30
00:01:21,925 --> 00:01:23,550
about the different
material properties

31
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,717
and what they actually mean.

32
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:28,470
So anyone remember what we
mean by toughness in relation

33
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,470
to this curve?

34
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,720
AUDIENCE: The area [INAUDIBLE]

35
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,410
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

36
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,810
The amount of energy it
would take to actually cause

37
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,650
this material to fail.

38
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,518
That's a measure of toughness.

39
00:01:38,518 --> 00:01:39,310
How about strength?

40
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,730
Remember this curve is stress,
which is a force per unit area,

41
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,623
versus strain, which is
an amount of elongation.

42
00:01:55,623 --> 00:01:57,290
The strength of the
material is how much

43
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,480
stress you can put
in until it starts

44
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,490
to either plastically
deform or it

45
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,420
hits its UTS, ultimate tensile
strength, where it will just

46
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,770
fail.

47
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,090
How about ductility?

48
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,030
What do we mean by that?

49
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,010
Either intuitively or
on the curve, yeah?

50
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,930
AUDIENCE: How much
you can stretch it?

51
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,530
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

52
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,363
How much you can stretch
it before it fails,

53
00:02:18,363 --> 00:02:20,490
indicated by this
point right here.

54
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,680
The strain to failure would
be a good measure of activity.

55
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,750
And finally, stiffness.

56
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,500
What do you think?

57
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,380
Stiffness is more of
a response function,

58
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,240
so it's how much does it deform
in relation to how much stress

59
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,930
you put into it.

60
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,090
So it's the slope
of this part right

61
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,280
here, so that's why I
want you guys to know

62
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,290
that we mean actually
different physical things

63
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,190
by these properties, which
will be important to note

64
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,250
when we start to discuss what
radiation damage actually does.

65
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,130
So the basic mechanism
of radiation damage

66
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,420
is like you might imagine.

67
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,810
Let's say this green particle
is a neutron or a heavy ion

68
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,440
or a proton or an
electron or anything.

69
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,680
Anything that's energetic enough
to cause atomic displacement.

70
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,100
So as that neutron
or whatever enters,

71
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,060
it will strike some of the
atoms in this perfect crystal,

72
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,390
creating what's called a
primary knock on atom, or PKA,

73
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,680
for short.

74
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,620
And then that neutron
and the released PKA

75
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,680
will go on to hit
more and more atoms,

76
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,410
resulting in what we
call a damage cascade,

77
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,653
leaving behind a lot of
different types of defects.

78
00:03:29,653 --> 00:03:31,570
We talked about these
last time, but I'll just

79
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,160
refresh your memory.

80
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,190
A vacancy is a type of defect
that, well, it's not really

81
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:36,970
a thing, right?

82
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,950
It's just the absence of
where an atom would have been,

83
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,850
but we refer to them
as defects of their own

84
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,310
that can diffuse and
move because let's say

85
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,360
another atom moved into the
position of this vacancy.

86
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,800
Then we can say the vacancy
moved to that atomic position.

87
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,510
There's also
interstitials, or atoms

88
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,730
where they shouldn't quite be.

89
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,820
And this leaves behind
a whole bunch of damage

90
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,220
that we quantify using
a measure called DPA,

91
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,380
or displacements per atom.

92
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,370
It's a simple measure of how
many times has every atom left.

93
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,150
It's a lot of sight.

94
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,590
That's it, though.

95
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,240
It's not actually
a unit of damage,

96
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,810
and I'll be giving
a talk at MRS,

97
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,660
the materials research
conference tomorrow, railing

98
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,415
against this DPA
unit because I'm

99
00:04:23,415 --> 00:04:25,290
going to explain this
a little bit right now.

100
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,630
What is a DPA?

101
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,210
A DPA measures the
number of times

102
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,360
that each atom has moved
out of its original site,

103
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,810
but it has nothing to do with
how many times it stays out

104
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,870
of its original site
because a lot of those atoms

105
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,470
will get knocked away and
then just move right back,

106
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,360
but the DPA part
only measure is what

107
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,510
we call the ballistic
stage of radiation damage.

108
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,840
Let's see if this works.

109
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,090
I've just realized I
can jump back to a slide

110
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,080
without inducing epilepsy.

111
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,290
Yeah.

112
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,930
So what DPA actually measures
is how many times does

113
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,610
this process happen?

114
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,120
How many times do the
atoms get knocked around?

115
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,100
But it says nothing
about where they end up,

116
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,050
and that's the really
interesting part

117
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,010
about specifically
radiation material science.

118
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,070
Because let's say one
of these interstitials

119
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,200
were then to combine with
one of these vacancies.

120
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,700
It's like they were never there.

121
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,740
Even though they were
displaced, and would

122
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,250
be counted as part of the DPA,
or the radiation damage dose,

123
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,570
the net effect on the
crystal material is nothing.

124
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,380
So let's say what
really the DPA is.

125
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,290
It's a simple formula that I
think you guys may recognize.

126
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,230
This look familiar
from all of neutronics

127
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,620
that we've been doing?

128
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,710
It's yet another reaction rate.

129
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,130
It's an energy dependent
flux times another type

130
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,580
of cross-section that we
call the damage displacement

131
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,140
cross-section, or
sigma D, and it's

132
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,120
integrated over your
entire energy range,

133
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,600
and that's all there is to it.

134
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,890
So with what you know 22.01, you
can understand the basic unit

135
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,480
of radiation damage.

136
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,503
As you might imagine, we've had
four lectures on neutronics,

137
00:06:03,503 --> 00:06:04,920
so if you can
understand all there

138
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,630
is to know about DPA after
four sophomore lectures,

139
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,080
it's probably a
pretty simple unit.

140
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,940
You're right, it is.

141
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,550
What goes into this damaged
displacement cross-section

142
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,370
is also something that
might look a little familiar

143
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,680
is a cross section
that says, what's

144
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,790
the probability of some
particle coming in with energy E

145
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:28,590
and imparting kinetic energy
T to another struck atom?

146
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,510
That comes right from--

147
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,260
remember our treatment--

148
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,450
I think I've drawn this
probably 50 times now.

149
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,840
Our hollow cylinder treatment
of a charged particle

150
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,710
with charge little ze
interacting with a particle

151
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:49,310
a big ZE at some
impact parameter B.

152
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,810
We wanted to know well,
for all possible approach

153
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:57,270
paths, the area of
this hollow circle,

154
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,790
or the probability that
this particular approach

155
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:06,870
path is taken, is just
the area here 2pi b db.

156
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,040
With some constants
in front of it,

157
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,890
which actually is
that cross section

158
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,820
what's the probability that our
particle goes in with energy E

159
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,590
and imparts kinetic energy T?

160
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,240
It's directly related to
that impact parameter B.

161
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,980
And this is the same thing
that you're seeing right here.

162
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,080
You then multiply by
this little function

163
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,310
nu of T, which represents
the amount of damage,

164
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,320
or the number of
displacements done,

165
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,230
for each one of these reactions.

166
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,560
And there are simple models,
there are mostly linear models

167
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,490
for--

168
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:43,180
if a particle comes in with
energy E, leaves with energy T,

169
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,010
how many displacements happen?

170
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,940
It's a pretty simple
linear piece-wise model,

171
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,690
and that fairly
well approximates

172
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,320
the number of
displacements that happen,

173
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,810
but I want to get the
idea of DPA versus damage.

174
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,270
They're two very
different things,

175
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,950
and they're often equated.

176
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,980
Much like the material
properties of strength,

177
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,150
ductility, hardness,
and toughness

178
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,740
are equated in
colloquial speech,

179
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,780
but that's absolutely wrong.

180
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,070
So is the idea of DPA
and radiation damage.

181
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,480
Because DPA, again,
just measures

182
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,060
the number of times that
an atom is displaced.

183
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,150
Damage is some measure of
the number of messed up atoms

184
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,650
at the end of the
game, and they operate

185
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,450
in very different timescales.

186
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,240
It takes femtoseconds
to picoseconds

187
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,810
for a damage cascade to happen.

188
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,580
So the DPA is all over in
less than a picosecond,

189
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,820
but it can take years for
all these different defects

190
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,960
to diffuse, to cluster up, and
to form these super structures,

191
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,970
and actually end up
causing the damage that

192
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:43,710
can lead to material
property degradation.

193
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,310
So what sort of
factors would affect

194
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,920
the speed at which these
different defects end up

195
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,080
finding each other?

196
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,770
What could you vary about a
material or its environment

197
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,753
to change the speed of these
atomic diffusion jumps?

198
00:08:57,753 --> 00:08:58,670
AUDIENCE: Temperature.

199
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,587
MICHAEL SHORT: Indeed.

200
00:08:59,587 --> 00:09:00,482
Temperature.

201
00:09:00,482 --> 00:09:02,690
Reading off my list-- well,
the whole list jumped up.

202
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:03,563
OK.

203
00:09:03,563 --> 00:09:04,480
You got the first one.

204
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,522
What were you going to say?

205
00:09:05,522 --> 00:09:07,000
AUDIENCE: I was going
to say temperature also.

206
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,640
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

207
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,348
Yeah, absolutely.

208
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:11,030
Temperature determines
diffusivities.

209
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:16,010
It also can change phases
or crystal arrangements,

210
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,730
like for the case of
anything iron-based.

211
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,040
The dose rate, the rate at
which those neutrons come in

212
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,430
can change the rate at which
the defects cluster up.

213
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,880
Chemistry, if you have solute
atoms, which I've drawn here.

214
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,640
You may have let's say
chromium atoms and iron,

215
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,710
and the chromium atoms
are a little bit bigger.

216
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,680
Defects may be
attracted to or repelled

217
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,130
to those extra solute atoms,
changing the way that they

218
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,750
interact with each other.

219
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,070
And then micro structure.

220
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,460
Things that are bigger
than on the order of atoms.

221
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,100
Grain boundaries, dislocations,
all of those defects

222
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,470
that we talked about last
time, just to refresh

223
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,250
your memory of what those are.

224
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,370
We have been talking about
zero dimensional defects

225
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,080
like vacancies.

226
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,350
We spent a while on
dislocations, these one

227
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:08,130
dimensional defects that other
defects can be attracted to.

228
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:11,400
We saw an example of a
two dimensional defect,

229
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,590
known as a grain
boundary, where you

230
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:18,340
can see this line between
different arrangements

231
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,930
of atoms.

232
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:23,450
And there can be three
dimensional defects.

233
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,190
Like inclusions of some separate
face sitting in the material.

234
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,250
Like the manganese sulfide we
found in the Alcator fusion

235
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,460
reactors power rotor.

236
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,500
And all of the
presence and density

237
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,750
of all those
different defects can

238
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,480
be quite strongly influenced.

239
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,168
Let me start that sentence over.

240
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:43,960
The movement in clustering
of those defects

241
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,270
can be quite strongly
influenced by the presence

242
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,820
of all those other defects.

243
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,550
So again, the DPA
actually tells us

244
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,830
this part of radiation
damage, and that's

245
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,400
what we tend to simulate
with these ballistic binary

246
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,140
collision approximation
simulations,

247
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,120
where we just say
like billiard balls,

248
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,010
how many atoms knock
into each other?

249
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,770
What it doesn't tell
us is everything else,

250
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,710
and it's the stuff that
happens here that can tell us

251
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,980
will our materials fail
in nuclear reactors?

252
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,230
And there's evidence for this.

253
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,820
I'm not just ranting
against it, no I am,

254
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,430
but I'm doing so with
evidence, so it's justified.

255
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,180
So here's a nice
experiment I like to show

256
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,730
in every talk for this case.

257
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,350
These folks took pure nickel
and put it in the same reactor,

258
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,350
at the same temperature, and
got the same amount of swelling.

259
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,725
All the conditions
were the same.

260
00:11:35,725 --> 00:11:38,680
Same temperature, same
materials, same microstructure,

261
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,990
same reactor, same
neutron energies.

262
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,820
Just a different dose rate.

263
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,220
A 30% difference in
the rate at which

264
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,500
neutrons arrived at
the nickel, and they

265
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,600
get the same result
in void swelling, one

266
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,730
of those bad things
that happens,

267
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,070
at two and a half times
the DPA, which tells us

268
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,310
that there's a very
strong dose rate effect

269
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,257
for material damage.

270
00:12:00,257 --> 00:12:02,090
So if you want to answer
the question, well,

271
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:06,050
how much dose does it take to
reach 3% swelling in nickel?

272
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,050
Can't answer that question, you
don't have enough information.

273
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,730
Even if you say, how
much dose does it

274
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,230
take with one of the neutrons
at 600 Celsius in this one

275
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:15,860
reactor?

276
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,720
You can't answer that question.

277
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,750
Kind of tricky.

278
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,470
And a lot of the rest of
nuclear materials data

279
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,620
looks something like this.

280
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,520
Now, I don't want you to
worry about what the axes say.

281
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,860
They're not readable because
they're not important.

282
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,815
What I do want you to know is
what's the quality of this data

283
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:30,440
set you see?

284
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,030
Would you be bold enough
to draw a trend line

285
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,670
through a single data point?

286
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,550
No.

287
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,610
What about three where
it doesn't actually

288
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,960
match up with one of them?

289
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,910
Or is there any
reason why you think

290
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,847
they made this parabolic
instead of a linear line?

291
00:12:51,847 --> 00:12:53,930
I can draw a line that
would fit between the error

292
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:57,090
bars of these two right here.

293
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,720
So the trick is doing these
experiments is extremely

294
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,730
difficult and expensive.

295
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:05,450
So just throwing something near
the MIT reactor for a month,

296
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,630
because we did this, we took
a few hundred milligrams

297
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,000
of copper, aluminum,
and nickel, threw it

298
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,620
in near core position of the MIT
reactor, and that cost $40,000,

299
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,810
and that did about 0.002
DPA, or about the dose

300
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,870
that you'd receive in a normal
power reactor in one day.

301
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,850
If you want to actually
say how long will it

302
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,520
take to get materials to the
end of their useful life,

303
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,750
this tends to be anywhere from
10 DPA in light water reactors,

304
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,290
to hundreds of DPA in
proposed fast reactors

305
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,410
to 500 DPA for TerraPower's
traveling wave reactor.

306
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,490
Now, I don't particularly have--

307
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,840
let's see what's 500
divided by 0.00--

308
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,260
I don't have 10,000 years to
wait for the final answer.

309
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,660
The best we can do right
now is to stick them

310
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,548
in a reactor called
BOR-60 in Russia.

311
00:13:51,548 --> 00:13:52,590
I've actually been there.

312
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,873
It's in the very Western
edge of Siberia--

313
00:13:54,873 --> 00:13:56,540
I don't know if you
could call it that--

314
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,600
in a city called Dimitrovgrad.

315
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,173
They have a sodium
cooled fast reactor.

316
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,590
For those of you
who are wondering

317
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,548
when our advanced reactor
is going to be built,

318
00:14:04,548 --> 00:14:08,470
they are built. Just not in
this country, not very much.

319
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,030
But Russia's got
a fleet of sodium

320
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:14,180
cooled fast reactors that
can get you 25 DPA per year.

321
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,080
And if your reactor is
going to go to 500 DPA,

322
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,720
you have to know whether or not
your materials will survive,

323
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,920
you have to wait 20
years for the answer.

324
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,920
So what investor is going
to be like, all right,

325
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,110
here's $10 billion,
but I can wait 20 years

326
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,730
for a return on investment.

327
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:28,360
No.

328
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,040
I can wait 20 years
to start building

329
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,480
the reactor, which
means 40 years

330
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,250
for a return on investment.

331
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,380
Chances are, if someone's
got $10 billion to give,

332
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,760
they're going to be dead by
the time they get a return.

333
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,565
So this is a no win proposition.

334
00:14:40,565 --> 00:14:41,940
So what we really
need to know is

335
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,900
what is the full population
of every single type of defect

336
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,640
in an irradiated material?

337
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,150
That's what I mean by damage.

338
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,660
Did I show you guys
this movie yet?

339
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,510
The orange one?

340
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,190
We've talked about vacancies
in an abstract sense,

341
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,340
but this is a movie of
one of them actually

342
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,720
moving about on the
surface of germanium.

343
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:07,410
So this is a scanning
tunneling microscope image--

344
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,970
I think that's what
it stands for--

345
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,870
and these are atoms on
the surface of germanium.

346
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,360
And that right there,
that darker orange thing

347
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,130
moving about is
vacancy diffusion.

348
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,130
It's actually happening.

349
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,315
You can see it in real time.

350
00:15:20,315 --> 00:15:21,690
AUDIENCE: Is this
real time then?

351
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,223
MICHAEL SHORT:
Pretty much, yeah.

352
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:24,390
So I think this was-- yeah--

353
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,820
30 frames a second, or so.

354
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,183
Anyway, I don't
remember exactly,

355
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:31,350
but I'd say that's why I
always reference everything

356
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,225
in the presentations.

357
00:15:32,225 --> 00:15:33,695
I encourage you
guys to look it up.

358
00:15:33,695 --> 00:15:35,820
And then the only reason
these slides aren't up yet

359
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,195
is because they're
300 megabytes,

360
00:15:37,195 --> 00:15:40,050
and I didn't have the bandwidth
to upload that from my house.

361
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,510
Now that I'm on campus, I can
get a 300 meg presentation

362
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,930
up there because
it's full of movies.

363
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:50,050
What sort of things could
happen to these defects?

364
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,330
So radiation produces
all these crazy defects,

365
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,560
then the DPA
description is over.

366
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,820
What could happen next?

367
00:16:00,104 --> 00:16:02,000
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

368
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,970
MICHAEL SHORT: Sorry,
Jared, and then-- yeah.

369
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,270
AUDIENCE: Material could crack.

370
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,770
MICHAEL SHORT:
Material could crack.

371
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,548
That would be the
worst case scenario,

372
00:16:08,548 --> 00:16:10,340
but that is indeed what
happens in the end,

373
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,590
and I'll show you some pictures
of that actually happened.

374
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,010
Yeah?

375
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,843
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
that displaced atoms

376
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:16,190
can find their way back?

377
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,360
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

378
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,300
So they could recombine with
different types of defects

379
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,950
and annihilate each other.

380
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,683
If you have a vacancy and
an interstitial nearby,

381
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,100
the interstitial
can plug the hole

382
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,800
of the vacancy and your left
with another perfect crystal.

383
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,820
But now what happens if two
vacancies find each other?

384
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,040
Then you've got the
makings of a void,

385
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,900
or we then call
it a small vacancy

386
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,540
cluster of two vacancies,
but it's actually

387
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,360
more stable for these
vacancies or interstitials

388
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,270
to find each other
and make these larger

389
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,550
defects than it is
for them to sit alone

390
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,970
in the crystal structure.

391
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,660
So there is a thermodynamic
driving force bringing them

392
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,200
together, and then as
those defects build up,

393
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,240
then what Jared
said could happen.

394
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,000
You could crack the material
because it could get weaker,

395
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,050
less ductile, less tough.

396
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,970
Weaker is the
opposite of strong,

397
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,520
and what's the other one?

398
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,920
Toughness-- oh, and
harder, actually.

399
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,569
So the origins
avoid swelling I'll

400
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:15,375
start with the humble vacancy.

401
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,730
A void is nothing but
a bunch of vacancies

402
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,470
or a pocket of vacuum
or gas in a material,

403
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:24,359
and it all has to start
with these single vacancies.

404
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:28,200
As they cluster together,
they reached this threshold

405
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,960
in terms of free energy
where putting a few of them

406
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,720
together is not quite
energetically favorable,

407
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,720
but it's not so unfavorable
that it never happens.

408
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,930
So once in a while, you'll get a
few vacancies to come together,

409
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:43,110
and that cluster will
survive for a little while.

410
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,170
All the while, you're making
more and more vacancies nearby,

411
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,610
and if it gets to
a certain size,

412
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,915
that free energy goes negative.

413
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:51,540
And when the free
energy goes negative,

414
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,960
it becomes stable on its
own, and then that void

415
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,360
will simply continue to
grow, and grow, and grow.

416
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,130
And so there's this process
of absorption and emission

417
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,260
of defects by larger
or smaller void,

418
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,790
so if you have a whole bunch
of voids near each other,

419
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,610
some of them can be
emitting vacancies,

420
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,422
which can be captured
by the other ones,

421
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,630
and this is part of why they
don't all just disappear

422
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,530
at once.

423
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,540
They have finite
lifetimes, long enough

424
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,670
that you can build
them up to the size

425
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,110
where they become stable.

426
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:23,250
Then this free energy eventually
curves down, becomes negative,

427
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,840
and then they just stick
around, and we've actually

428
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,760
seen these clusters
or voids diffusing,

429
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,380
so it's not like vacancies alone
are the only thing that moves.

430
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,850
We've actually seen clusters
of defects diffusing, mostly

431
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,130
in one dimension, but
what you're seeing here

432
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,400
is a TEM, or transmission
electron microscope image,

433
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,580
of one dimensional diffusion
of a vacancy cluster.

434
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,650
That little black
blob right there

435
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:52,080
is a pocket of vacuum that's
moving back and forth.

436
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,320
And if it happens to find
another pocket of vacuum,

437
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,110
it could then combine
to a bigger pocket,

438
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,000
becoming a bigger
and bigger void.

439
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,520
The other problem too
is that most materials

440
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,420
generate helium when you
irradiate them with neutrons.

441
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:12,780
Did we go over the what's called
the N alpha cross-section?

442
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,777
Does that sound
familiar to anyone?

443
00:19:14,777 --> 00:19:16,360
All right, I'm going
to pull up Janice

444
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,080
like I do pretty
much every class.

445
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,360
Let me show you what's going on.

446
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,570
But this is an
important one to note.

447
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:29,780
Because a pocket a vacuum
is not that stable,

448
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,220
but if you get a
little bit of gas

449
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,262
to stabilize that
pocket of vacuum,

450
00:19:33,262 --> 00:19:34,970
then that pressure
differential goes down

451
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:38,710
and that void becomes a bubble,
and that bubble is more stable.

452
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,210
Good.

453
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,490
Because on the
last isotope, where

454
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,115
I was showing someone
[INAUDIBLE] alpha

455
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:43,190
cross-section.

456
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,280
How convenient.

457
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,460
So among the millions
of cross sections

458
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,620
that we've gone through,
there is this one right

459
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,420
here called Z alpha.

460
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,720
So what-- Yeah?

461
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,087
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

462
00:19:57,087 --> 00:19:58,750
MICHAEL SHORT: Got
to clone the screen.

463
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,292
That's right.

464
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:01,620
Thanks.

465
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,700
There we go.

466
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,100
So there's this one here
called Z alpha, which

467
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,670
means neutron comes in,
alpha particle goes out,

468
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,830
alpha particle is
just an ionized helium

469
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,950
ion, which very quickly
pulls in two electrons

470
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,430
from anywhere else in the
metal and becomes helium gas.

471
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,780
And this cross-section
is not zero,

472
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,830
especially at higher energy
starting around 2 MeV,

473
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,470
there is a small, but
non-negligible chance

474
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,902
that a neutron will go in,
and a helium atom comes out.

475
00:20:30,902 --> 00:20:32,360
And those helium
atoms have nowhere

476
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,270
to go, they find the
easiest place to sit,

477
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,820
that happens to be
pockets of vacuum.

478
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,170
Voids.

479
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,710
And what that actually does
is stabilizes those voids so

480
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,170
the curve I showed
you back here.

481
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:50,650
This is the case of free energy
for a vacuum pocket of void,

482
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,000
and that free energy gets
lower and lower as you start

483
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,640
to fill that void with gas.

484
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,430
So as the voids
fill with gas, they

485
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,950
become more and more stable,
and a lot of materials

486
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,910
generate their own gas.

487
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:08,232
So that's that, and they end
up forming these bubbles.

488
00:21:08,232 --> 00:21:10,690
You guys remember, last time
I showed you a bunch of voids.

489
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:13,358
They look like diamonds all
aligned in the same direction.

490
00:21:13,358 --> 00:21:14,650
What do you see different here?

491
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,600
They're not quite
circles, right?

492
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,110
But they're kind of
round edge squares.

493
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,300
They are also all pointing
in the same direction.

494
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,630
If you look carefully
at this one,

495
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,175
this one, the one above it.

496
00:21:32,175 --> 00:21:33,300
And the big one over there.

497
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,900
It's harder to see
for the small ones,

498
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,960
but for these
three big ones, you

499
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,420
can see that they're all
rotated in the same direction,

500
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,090
giving away the crystal
orientation of the material.

501
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,590
But the reason that
they're starting

502
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:47,840
to swell up from diamonds into
bubbles, is they're full of gas

503
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,670
and they stabilize the voids.

504
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:53,310
You can also get
dislocation buildup.

505
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:56,010
Normally, you would have
to deform a material

506
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:59,910
to create and move dislocations,
but when you apply radiation,

507
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:03,727
you can just create
dislocations.

508
00:22:03,727 --> 00:22:04,560
I mean look at that.

509
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,820
This is kind of cool.

510
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,460
You've got a dislocation
source right here.

511
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,560
Every one of those lines
you see is a dislocation,

512
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,530
and you can see it's spiraling
out and ejecting dislocations

513
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,360
from this one little spot.

514
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,210
Any combination
of small clusters

515
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:21,810
can collapse into dislocations
or the stress induced

516
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:24,330
from irradiating things
can cause more stress that

517
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,088
can move more dislocations.

518
00:22:26,088 --> 00:22:27,630
You create what's
called this network

519
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,030
forest of dislocations
that makes

520
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,890
things a lot harder to deform.

521
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,710
So let's see, I want to show
a couple more videos of this

522
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,200
because it's very
clear in some of these.

523
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,860
You can actually see along
these lines right here

524
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,830
a few different orientations
of dislocations,

525
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,380
and if you watch
up here, you can

526
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,420
see some dislocations
moving, and then

527
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,650
there's a source that
emits more right there,

528
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,517
and so all the time, you're
creating dislocations

529
00:22:57,517 --> 00:22:59,350
that are being emitted
from different places

530
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,433
and colliding with each other.

531
00:23:01,433 --> 00:23:03,100
The trick that we
didn't talk about yet,

532
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,290
is when dislocations
from different directions

533
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,720
collide, they get stuck.

534
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,930
And when they get
stuck, they can't move.

535
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:14,350
And when they can't move, you
shift the balance from slip

536
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,210
to fracture, which
means, like Jared said,

537
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,840
it's easier to just break
something, rather than

538
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,150
plastically deform it.

539
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,360
And the effects of this
are things like stiffening.

540
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,730
An increase in the
Young's Modulus.

541
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,130
Because if you remove
some of the compliance

542
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:33,613
from the material or make
it stiffer by injecting

543
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:35,030
all sorts of
different defects, it

544
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,872
takes more stress to
impart the same strain.

545
00:23:38,872 --> 00:23:40,580
That might not be a
bad thing on its own.

546
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,038
Your materials get stronger,
that sounds like a good thing,

547
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:44,470
right?

548
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:49,498
Not always because it doesn't
just come as stiffening.

549
00:23:49,498 --> 00:23:51,040
But now from an
atomic point of view,

550
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,140
why does this stiffening happen?

551
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,070
Anybody have an idea?

552
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:04,450
I'm going to jump back to
the stress strain curve.

553
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,580
So the stress, or the
yield stress of a material,

554
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,160
is usually defined as
this point right here.

555
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,370
When you go from elastic
reversible deformation

556
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,980
to irreversible
plastic deformation.

557
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,480
If something gets
stronger, it means

558
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,300
that this yield stress goes up.

559
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,450
And if something gets stiffer,
it means the slope goes up.

560
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:25,230
These two tend to
happen at the same time.

561
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,070
So if something is
stiffer and stronger, then

562
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:31,520
the stress strain curve would
be drawn more like that.

563
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,120
And what actually physically
happens at this point?

564
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,020
This is when dislocations
start to move.

565
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,160
Dislocation movement
is irreversible.

566
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,660
You can't just snap it back
when you relieve the stress.

567
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,270
And by making something
stronger and stiffer,

568
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,370
you make it more difficult
for those dislocations

569
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:50,050
to start moving.

570
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:53,080
And you can do that by throwing
any defect in their way.

571
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,630
And since radiation creates
pretty much any and all

572
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,568
defects, it's a great way
to stiffen and strengthen

573
00:24:58,568 --> 00:24:59,110
the material.

574
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,460
So one of the reasons things
get stiffer and stronger

575
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,340
is, remember before we showed
you that video of dislocation

576
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,805
sliding through material?

577
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:14,680
Folks don't remember.

578
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,290
I'll bring it up right now.

579
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,790
I didn't see a lot
of shaking heads.

580
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,240
This one, right?

581
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,820
This one right here.

582
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,240
So remember, before,
we showed you

583
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,840
the way that dislocations move.

584
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,950
So the ways that materials
can deform without breaking.

585
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,040
If you throw
anything in its way,

586
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,100
you're going to make this
process a lot more difficult.

587
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,880
And all radiation damage does
is throw things in the way.

588
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,280
So if you throw
absolutely anything

589
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:52,888
in the way from solute atoms
to interstitials to vacancies,

590
00:25:52,888 --> 00:25:54,930
all of a sudden, it's
harder for that dislocation

591
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,180
to move because some of those
bonds are stretched out,

592
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,550
or there's a few extra
atoms in the way.

593
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,280
And you can then
start to create what's

594
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,300
called little pin
sections called jogs.

595
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,390
Let's say a little vacancy
moves over to this dislocation,

596
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:12,210
meaning that it goes up
by one atomic position.

597
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,340
Then you've got pieces
of this dislocation that

598
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:19,417
are not in this preferential
slip plane, and they get stuck.

599
00:26:19,417 --> 00:26:21,625
So all of a sudden you go
from a completely gliding--

600
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:23,700
or what we call
glissile dislocation--

601
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,950
to one that's stuck,
or sessine, those

602
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,630
are the actual material
science words that we use.

603
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,280
And what it ends up leading to
is a strong loss in ductility.

604
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:36,090
At the same time as things
get stronger and stiffer,

605
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,070
they tend to get
much less ductile.

606
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:41,970
So what you're looking
at here are fuel shrouds.

607
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:45,810
These are fuel boxes that
surround the fuel pins

608
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:48,725
in a Russian sodium fast
reactor, and usually

609
00:26:48,725 --> 00:26:50,850
what you do is you would
grab onto this piece right

610
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,940
here and lift up to remove
this fuel from the reactor

611
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,320
during refueling.

612
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,040
What happened here is they grab
that, they started to pull,

613
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,610
and they heard a little clink,
and up came half the fuel box,

614
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,040
and the fuel stayed down
in the reactor with no way

615
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,660
to pull it out.

616
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,270
So this is the reason why
radiation damage is such

617
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,550
an important field of
study is you might not

618
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,730
know anything has happened
until you shut the reactor down

619
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,460
and go to take out
the fuel and realize

620
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,180
that you can't
because everything

621
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,040
is as brittle as glass.

622
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,100
This is actually a
talk I saw yesterday.

623
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,430
We had a summer visitor in
our lab from Kazakhstan.

624
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,518
And most of their
radioactive materials

625
00:27:28,518 --> 00:27:30,060
came from this
reactor that shut down

626
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:34,080
in 1999 on one
side of Kazakhstan,

627
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,150
and they wanted to
transport those materials

628
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,590
to the other side.

629
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,840
So they hired the
cheapest truck drivers

630
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,580
to go on the bumpy roads.

631
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,700
And the scientists were
freaking out, because only

632
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,873
they knew that all of the metal
that all those guys thought

633
00:27:47,873 --> 00:27:49,290
was going to be
ductile like metal

634
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,300
was more brittle than glass.

635
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:55,890
And any sort of bump would
cause just complete shattering

636
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:00,090
of this metal and
catastrophic release

637
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,920
of radioactive material.

638
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,510
So this took them--

639
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,510
let's see-- I think Kazakhstan
is smaller than the US.

640
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,780
So who here has done
a cross-country trip?

641
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,850
How long it take you?

642
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,807
AUDIENCE: Six days
from Seattle to here.

643
00:28:12,807 --> 00:28:14,890
MICHAEL SHORT: OK, and did
you stop along the way?

644
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:15,515
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

645
00:28:15,515 --> 00:28:18,080
MICHAEL SHORT: OK, so this
trip took them 13 days

646
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,940
because they went slow.

647
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,818
And I don't think the
roads in Kazakhstan

648
00:28:21,818 --> 00:28:24,360
are as good as they are in most
of the middle of the country.

649
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,950
The coasts are terrible, but
the middle is pretty good.

650
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,260
So this trip went slow
because the scientists

651
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,980
said this happens.

652
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,917
You should be careful.

653
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:35,000
And luckily, there were
no problems and no release

654
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,890
of radioactive material.

655
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,320
Pretty cool.

656
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,930
What you want to happen
is for dislocations

657
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,640
to move on the easiest planes.

658
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,460
And so what I have
redrawn here is,

659
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,770
let's say you've got
a bar of some metal,

660
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:53,540
some face-centered cubic metal,
as you pull on it, like this,

661
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:57,440
it will actually deform at
about a 45 degree angles.

662
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,967
You might wonder,
why does that happen?

663
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:01,550
But if you look
carefully here, what's

664
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:04,850
the closest packed plane
of atoms that you can see?

665
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:08,150
It's not this plane normal
to the stress direction.

666
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,390
It's like this one
or like this one,

667
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,760
and so you actually end
up getting deformation

668
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,000
in what's called slip plains,
or the easiest directions

669
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,570
for things to deform.

670
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,870
And without going into any
of the math or atomistics,

671
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,120
I just want to show you
some examples pulled out

672
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,040
of, again, the fusion reactor.

673
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,690
So this is a piece of rotor
steel from the same Alcator

674
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,950
rotor where we found
that inclusion.

675
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,410
We were pulling it in
this direction, and look

676
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,850
what formed.

677
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:38,815
All of these slip bands
at 45 degree angles,

678
00:29:38,815 --> 00:29:40,190
showing you that
just because you

679
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,690
pull in something
in one direction,

680
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:44,090
doesn't mean it deforms
in that direction.

681
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:47,180
It deforms and little
slices in the direction

682
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,755
that dislocations
can move the easiest.

683
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:51,380
So when you actually
pull on something,

684
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,590
to show you diagrammatically,
it deforms something like that.

685
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,250
You get a mixture of
bending and rotation

686
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:01,570
to make it look like the bar
is bending uniformly straight,

687
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:04,930
but on the microscale, it's not.

688
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:08,190
So this is a pretty slick image
of a single crystal of cadmium

689
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:11,700
being pulled in this
direction, and you can actually

690
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,300
see every plane there,
that's a slip plane.

691
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,710
That's a plane
where dislocations

692
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:20,055
have been moving all the way
to the outside of the material,

693
00:30:20,055 --> 00:30:21,930
which is pretty cool,
and this is the process

694
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:24,120
that you want to happen.

695
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,490
Anything in the way
of those dislocations,

696
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,680
you don't start forming
these slip bands,

697
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,050
and you'd make it more
preferable that the thing will

698
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,500
just break and fracture.

699
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,440
To show you some extreme
examples of slip,

700
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,330
that's when you have to go nano.

701
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,360
So these are some
pillar compression test

702
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,260
that used a focused
ion beam, which

703
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,260
we will be using to top
off our study of electron

704
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,080
interactions with matter
and ion interactions

705
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,220
to take a piece of metal and
carve out a little cylinder.

706
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,020
And all they did is smash.

707
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,290
They came down and compressively
pushed on the cylinder,

708
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,250
and look how it deformed.

709
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,980
Not in the way you might
intuitively expect,

710
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,440
if you don't know
any material science.

711
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,750
So it deformed all
on 45 degree angles

712
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:10,200
and very weird compression.

713
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,553
Not actually weird, if
you know what's going on.

714
00:31:13,553 --> 00:31:15,220
there's lots more
neat examples of this.

715
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,590
If you don't push too
hard, you can actually

716
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:21,880
see these perfectly symmetrical
slip planes at 45 degree angles

717
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,870
to the axis of
compression, and you

718
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:27,040
know every one of these
pillars you see this happening.

719
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,605
And this is what you want to
happen to nuclear materials

720
00:31:30,605 --> 00:31:32,230
because you're really
trying to balance

721
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:37,045
this between slip and fracture
towards the direction of slip.

722
00:31:37,045 --> 00:31:39,545
That means that something will
deform a little bit before it

723
00:31:39,545 --> 00:31:45,338
just shatters like those channel
boxes from the Russian reactor.

724
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:46,880
Any questions on
what I said before I

725
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,071
go on to the
macroscale properties?

726
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,410
All right, and let's get
into the real world stuff.

727
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,900
What actually causes
this embrittlement?

728
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,000
Well, there's a few things.

729
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,600
Remember we saw videos of those
dislocations in a traffic jam.

730
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,210
If not, then I'll refresh
your guy's memory.

731
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:13,430
It's a phenomenon called
pileup, let's see.

732
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,850
There is the traffic jam.

733
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,570
Do you guys remember
this video now--

734
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:21,850
I know it's been a week,
but these dislocations

735
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,430
are moving and feeling
each other's stress,

736
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:27,340
and so they can't move as
easily as they would want to,

737
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,710
so you end up with a
phenomenon called pileup.

738
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:33,250
This happens both near
other dislocations

739
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:37,860
and near any other defect
that gets in the way,

740
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,520
like a grain boundary.

741
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,980
So for smaller materials you
end up with more of this pileup,

742
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:49,050
and they tend to be of a fair
bit stronger, and a fair bit--

743
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,680
they can be less ductile,
with some exceptions.

744
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,438
I won't say they're
always less ductile,

745
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,230
but if you put anything
in the way, notice,

746
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,180
this just says barrier.

747
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,250
Any other defect can
act as a barrier.

748
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,710
And this ends up
shifting what we

749
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:05,070
call the ductile-brittle
transition temperature.

750
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,260
This is the property
that people worry

751
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,670
about for reactor
pressure vessels,

752
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:12,310
because you would want the
pressure vessel, which in cases

753
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:15,040
the entire core of
the reactor, to always

754
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,870
be ductile in the worst
possible situation.

755
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,990
The worst possible situation
is on the absolute last day

756
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,600
of operation at the
coldest temperature

757
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,400
it could possibly be.

758
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,040
As you guys know, or
you probably know,

759
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,620
when you make something colder,
it tends to be more brittle.

760
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,130
So who's frozen stuff in liquid
nitrogen and broken it before?

761
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:35,630
Good.

762
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,010
I'm glad to see a
few hands, so what

763
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,218
do you guys freeze and break?

764
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:45,790
So just like froze a bottle of
Pepto Bismol and shattered it?

765
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,570
Nice.

766
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,973
That must have been a
fun mess to clean up.

767
00:33:48,973 --> 00:33:50,140
Yeah, what about you, Sarah?

768
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,290
AUDIENCE: A banana and a coin.

769
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,300
MICHAEL SHORT: Cool, OK.

770
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,180
And we're able to
break the coin?

771
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,110
There you go.

772
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,720
So normally you'd be
able to bend a coin,

773
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,390
or if it's a one yen coin,
you can bite through it.

774
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,760
Not when immersed in liquid
nitrogen. What about you,

775
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,480
Charlie?

776
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,230
AUDIENCE: Flowers.

777
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:05,890
MICHAEL SHORT: Flowers, OK.

778
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:06,400
Classic.

779
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,710
So take a rose and shatter it.

780
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,489
Yeah.

781
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:12,909
All these normally ductile
materials become extremely

782
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:14,320
brittle when they get colder.

783
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,330
So do reactor pressure vessels.

784
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,190
The problem is, they
don't just get brittle

785
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,290
when they get to liquid
nitrogen temperatures.

786
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,707
At the end of their
life, they can

787
00:34:21,707 --> 00:34:25,030
be brittle at room temperature
from radiation damage.

788
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,280
So there is what's called a
ductile-brittle transition

789
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,570
temperature before a pressure
vessels are irradiated,

790
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:35,050
there's about this 50% line,
whatever this temperature was

791
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:38,650
where you have let's say,
50%, or 10%, or 0% ductility.

792
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,420
Whatever measure
you're using, you

793
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,190
say, OK, we always
want to make sure

794
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:45,219
that it's got a certain
amount of energy absorption

795
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:49,159
capability, toughness,
at a certain temperature.

796
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:51,159
And as you irradiate
that vessel,

797
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:55,810
this shifts over this way, and
this upper amount of energy,

798
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:58,240
this USE, or what we
call upper shelf energy,

799
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,650
because this looks like
a shelf, goes down.

800
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,990
What you want to make
sure is that this change

801
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,360
in ductile-brittle
transition temperature

802
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,390
never reaches room temperature.

803
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:13,510
You might think, oh, it's OK,
reactors run at 300 Celsius,

804
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:16,512
and things are pretty
ductile right there.

805
00:35:16,512 --> 00:35:18,970
Well, you usually have to shut
the reactor down once you're

806
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:22,120
done with it to refuel, and
if something goes wrong,

807
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,920
there's a pressure
spike, you can

808
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,140
have a condition called
pressurized thermal shock,

809
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,710
or PTS.

810
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,570
In that case, you would have
a sudden pressure wave from,

811
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:35,180
let's say, from steam explosion
or whatever you could have,

812
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,790
and you want that vessel to
be able to absorb that energy

813
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:40,670
instead of breaking in half,
because if you break it half,

814
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:43,210
that's a radioactive release.

815
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:46,180
The way you test ductile-brittle
transition temperature

816
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,850
is what's called a
Charpy impact test.

817
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:54,220
It's probably the highest tech,
lowest tech test I've seen.

818
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,650
You simply hit
things with a hammer.

819
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:00,520
A very well calibrated,
precise hammer.

820
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,000
Let me pause so you can see
what the sample looks like.

821
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,710
You have these little
bars with a notch in them.

822
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:09,700
The notch is to make sure that
acts as a stress concentrator,

823
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,810
and you know where the
breaks going to happen.

824
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:16,180
So in a Charpy test, you
line up this little sample,

825
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,930
and you've got-- actually
in your reactors, usually,

826
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,850
you've got pieces of
the pressure vessel

827
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:25,330
in this form lining the inside
rim of the reactor pressure

828
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,110
vessel.

829
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,880
So every time you
refuel your reactor,

830
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,340
you take off another
few of these out

831
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,820
and you hit them with a
very well calibrated hammer.

832
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:38,760
And you can measure by
actually turning this dial

833
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,920
and letting the hammer
turn it as it moves

834
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,780
through the
material, you can see

835
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,390
how much energy was
absorbed by the material

836
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:47,040
as the hammer comes back up.

837
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,190
So it breaks right through
the material, in this case,

838
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:55,850
it's in a quenched or brittle
condition, and for some reason,

839
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,950
they have a lot of footage
of the guy standing

840
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,750
and not breathing,
but what I want

841
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:05,040
to show you is what
actually happens here.

842
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,790
I didn't make the
video, I just got it.

843
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,330
There we go.

844
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:12,850
So what you can see is
that if the hammer were

845
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:15,880
to move through air
with absolutely no drag,

846
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,280
it would come back
to the zero position.

847
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,170
If they had encountered
some resistance,

848
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,210
like with a piece
of steel in the way,

849
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:25,390
it then measures the
amount of energy in joules

850
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:28,930
that piece of steel absorbs
from the hammer blow.

851
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,910
The larger that is, the better.

852
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,950
And by doing this
test at a number

853
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,290
of different
temperatures, you can

854
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:38,170
recreate this ductile-brittle
transition temperature curve.

855
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,540
So they'll take a
few Charpy coupons,

856
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,510
they will test them at,
let's say, every 25 Celsius,

857
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:47,050
get a bunch of points, draw
the line through the points,

858
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:49,210
and decide where is
the material brittle.

859
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:53,760
At what temperature
will it become brittle?

860
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,127
To show you what something looks
like when it's not brittle.

861
00:37:57,127 --> 00:37:58,710
The same test is
done in what's called

862
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,200
the normalized condition,
where you simply heat

863
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,480
the steel to a high
temperature, relaxing out

864
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,180
most of the defects, and
bringing back as much

865
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,850
of the perfect crystal
structure as possible, which

866
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:11,820
is really good for letting
dislocations move through it.

867
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,540
So the same test is done by
the same awkward feller who

868
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,540
likes to stand there
and not breathe,

869
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:23,212
but you'll notice a very
different result of this test.

870
00:38:23,212 --> 00:38:24,920
Doesn't look like it,
but if you actually

871
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,910
look at how much energy was
absorbed, much, much higher.

872
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:31,910
So something like 18
times more energy,

873
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,430
and you can qualitatively
see the difference

874
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,230
between these two
conditions by looking

875
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,450
at the fractured surfaces,
and this is where

876
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,070
it starts to get intuitive.

877
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,900
Something that's
ductile would tear more

878
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,140
like taffy, where
something that's brittle

879
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,240
would cleave or break
in half much more

880
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,767
smoothly, so these are
the two pieces of metal

881
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:50,600
that we just showed.

882
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:55,010
You the one that absorbed 180
joules by lots of defamation,

883
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:58,220
and the one that absorbed
10 joules by fracture

884
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,720
in a brutal way.

885
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:04,040
This is what you want your
reactor vessel to behave like,

886
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,500
but the problem with these
ductile-brittle transition

887
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,450
temperature curves, is
this not just this part

888
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:11,270
that you're worried
about, it's that part.

889
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:15,320
So even at high temperatures,
things get less ductile.

890
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,840
So it's a combination of
temperature and number

891
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,980
of defects.

892
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,230
And if either one of
these criteria fails,

893
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,900
if you become too brittle
at low temperature,

894
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,950
or your total ductility at high
temperature goes down too much,

895
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:30,500
that's the end of life
of your reactor vessel,

896
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,740
and this is one of the biggest
problems in life extensions

897
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,450
of light water reactors.

898
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,640
They were built for 40
years and they originally

899
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,035
had license for 40 years.

900
00:39:39,035 --> 00:39:41,660
How many of you guys have heard
of the license extensions going

901
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,970
on now, to 60 or 80 years?

902
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,610
Yeah, so a few of you guys.

903
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:48,050
I've heard heard, why not
run the reactor longer.

904
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,610
Not build a new one,
but keep getting

905
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:52,220
all this clean green
cheap nuclear energy?

906
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,660
This is why.

907
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:57,350
You have to be absolutely
sure that your vessel,

908
00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:00,380
your primary containment,
will survive.

909
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:06,370
And we're not so
sure because well, we

910
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:11,080
jump to the part of the video
that's got the Charpy coupons.

911
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,610
Those.

912
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,970
We ran out.

913
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:17,190
We only plan to put
these vessels in service

914
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:21,300
for 40 years, and folks put 40
years worth of these coupons,

915
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,700
plus some extras, in
the reactor vessel.

916
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,550
Now, in order to prove
that it's actually

917
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,950
safe to continue
operation, you have

918
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:32,190
to have some amount
of material to test

919
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,270
and say, OK, this
vessel is still ductile,

920
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,417
it's still going to work.

921
00:40:35,417 --> 00:40:36,000
What happened?

922
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,923
What do you do when
you run out of coupons?

923
00:40:38,923 --> 00:40:40,340
Anyone have any
ideas, because I'm

924
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,480
sure the industry would
love to hear them.

925
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,480
AUDIENCE: Would you have
to start using material

926
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,810
from the vessel itself?

927
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,600
MICHAEL SHORT: You could start
using material from the vessel.

928
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,170
That's actually what I plan
to do too, but with some very

929
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:52,950
strong caveat.

930
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,580
So if you were to scoop
out a piece of the vessel,

931
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,920
you then create a
stress concentration.

932
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,910
In addition, reactor vessel
looks like a gigantic forging

933
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:10,720
of really thick carbon
steel with a very thin liner

934
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,770
of stainless steel.

935
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:18,820
And the stainless steel is
there to prevent corrosion

936
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,490
from the reactor water.

937
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:25,960
That thin, quarter inch
bit of stainless steel

938
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,420
is what actually
saved what could

939
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,503
have been one of the worst
nuclear accidents in US

940
00:41:29,503 --> 00:41:31,810
history, the Davis
Bessie plant, where there

941
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:33,280
was a crack in the vessel.

942
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,980
Boric acid actually ate
through a whole chunk

943
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,950
of the pressure vessel, leaving
the stainless steel intact.

944
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:44,200
And it's that little quarter
inch stainless steel that

945
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,418
saved the plant.

946
00:41:45,418 --> 00:41:46,960
But if you were to
take something out

947
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,377
from the inside of the vessel,
the part that gets the most

948
00:41:49,377 --> 00:41:54,800
damage, you'd be taking out some
of the stainless steel, which

949
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,090
is a problem.

950
00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:00,640
You could take a piece out
from here, maybe the outside,

951
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,860
but then you've got a
stress concentrator.

952
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,080
Any sort of chunk
that is missing

953
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,600
is where a crack is going
to preferentially form,

954
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,690
so you would weaken that
vessel by taking a piece out.

955
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,050
Anyone else have any ideas?

956
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:12,550
Yeah?

957
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:14,860
AUDIENCE: Is it impossible
to just replace the vessel?

958
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,652
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

959
00:42:15,652 --> 00:42:17,620
A new vessel means
a new reactor.

960
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,570
So the license for the
plant is intimately

961
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,940
tied to the license
for the vessel.

962
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,530
Any other ideas?

963
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:24,440
Yeah?

964
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,690
AUDIENCE: The creation of the
vessel, just put extra in there

965
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,110
and then take that out.

966
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,360
MICHAEL SHORT: That's
what they did, right?

967
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,850
So that's why these
Charpy coupons were there,

968
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:36,560
but what do we do about the
vessels that we already have?

969
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,060
Yeah?

970
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,100
AUDIENCE: Can you make
Charpy coupon or coupons

971
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:43,630
that are similar to the status
of the ones most recently taken

972
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:46,540
out of the vessel, and
then just put them in?

973
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,320
MICHAEL SHORT: That's
what they're doing.

974
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,160
So they're taking these
Charpy coupons, which this

975
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,230
is bigger than actual size.

976
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:57,070
They break them, so let's say
this region's all garbage,

977
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:00,712
and then they cut a little
mini Charpy coupons out

978
00:43:00,712 --> 00:43:02,920
of the last piece, and
they're putting those back in.

979
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,180
So that's absolutely right.

980
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:07,210
You've just probably recreated
a year's worth of licensing work

981
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,965
and ideas and in a class.

982
00:43:08,965 --> 00:43:10,840
But I just want to get
back to Charlie's idea

983
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,670
because that's what
I think has to happen

984
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:15,040
is you'd like to be
able to take a piece out

985
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,170
from the actual vessel
and run a test on it.

986
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,710
The only way to do
that is to go nano.

987
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:23,410
Take the tiniest,
tiniest little piece out,

988
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:26,720
and perform some other
sort of measurement.

989
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,850
So this is the
idea that our group

990
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:32,180
has had in using what's called
stored energy of radiation

991
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:35,580
damage, so I don't mind
telling you about it,

992
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:38,910
even though it's not like
funded or papered yet

993
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:42,940
because it's educational,
and it's cool.

994
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:46,750
So every kind of defect
takes energy to create.

995
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,670
Defects don't just
create themselves.

996
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,920
You either have to raise the
temperature of a material

997
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,720
or in our case, irradiate it.

998
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,690
And it's the energy of
those incoming neutrons that

999
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:58,450
bounces around different
atoms and creates

1000
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,770
all these different
types of defects.

1001
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:03,668
So those defects are storing
energy in the material.

1002
00:44:03,668 --> 00:44:05,710
And so if you think about
how much energy does it

1003
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,168
take to destroy
something, it would

1004
00:44:07,168 --> 00:44:10,870
have to be the energy that it's
already stored plus the energy

1005
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:13,000
that you put into
it during the test

1006
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,220
can reach the failure energy.

1007
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,410
What if you could measure
the stored energy?

1008
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:18,967
What if there was
a way to know how

1009
00:44:18,967 --> 00:44:20,800
many of each of those
defects there actually

1010
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,570
were in a material?

1011
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:23,710
We think there is.

1012
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:24,880
Well, we know there is.

1013
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,000
It's called differential
scanning color imagery.

1014
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,370
It's a way of
measuring the change

1015
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:33,970
in heat capacity of a
material, where you take two

1016
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:35,782
very small furnaces--

1017
00:44:35,782 --> 00:44:37,990
you don't have to put this
in your notes, by the way,

1018
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:40,040
this is just for fun.

1019
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:45,080
You take two small furnaces,
put your chunk of your material

1020
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:51,000
on one, and you apply a lot
of heat to both of them.

1021
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:58,030
And you look at the difference
in the amount of heat

1022
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:01,300
you have to put in to keep the
two at the same temperature.

1023
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,790
So normally, you would
get the heat capacity

1024
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:07,690
of a material, how much heat
can extort per degree Kelvin.

1025
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:11,560
If this material's got a bunch
of defects already in it,

1026
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,440
then you should release that
defect energy by heating it

1027
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,160
and that would take a little
less energy to heat it up,

1028
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,770
but there's a lot of
problems with calorimetry,

1029
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:23,740
so we're actually using
what's called nanocalorimetry.

1030
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:27,460
We're doing this process
on nanograms of material

1031
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,740
and seeing if you can
irradiate something and measure

1032
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,660
its stored energy
because if you could,

1033
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,910
you could take a tiny
little razor blade,

1034
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:36,820
take out the smallest
sliver of the vessel--

1035
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:38,200
smaller than a grain of sand.

1036
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,150
Not enough to cause a crack--

1037
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:42,165
enough to measure
its stored energy.

1038
00:45:42,165 --> 00:45:44,540
And I want to show you guys
what this process looks like.

1039
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,080
So I'm just going to deviate
from the actual lecture,

1040
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,880
and jump into the topic
I'll give tomorrow.

1041
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,910
I think it's more interesting
and more relevant.

1042
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:01,310
There we go.

1043
00:46:04,705 --> 00:46:06,580
I'm going to skip through
some of this stuff,

1044
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,560
but it's within the
last five minutes,

1045
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,810
I'll try to get through this,
see if this is a record.

1046
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,780
It's what we call the
ultimate snipe hunt.

1047
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,260
Has anyone here been
on a snipe hunt?

1048
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:16,208
What's a snipe hunt?

1049
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:18,500
AUDIENCE: People bringing
you in the woods and tell you

1050
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,750
you're looking for a
bird that doesn't exist.

1051
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,280
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

1052
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,690
Pretty much this, right?

1053
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,640
They say bang a bunch
of sticks, get a bag,

1054
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,630
and go look for snipes.

1055
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:28,310
They don't exist, right?

1056
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:30,540
They actually do.

1057
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,785
Snipes are real.

1058
00:46:31,785 --> 00:46:33,865
You pretty much have to
be British to know it,

1059
00:46:33,865 --> 00:46:35,490
because they hunt
them there for sport,

1060
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:37,290
and apparently,
they're delicious.

1061
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:39,920
That's actually where
we get the term snipe

1062
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,950
because the actual size of the
sniper compared to the sniper

1063
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,030
is about that.

1064
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:45,830
If you can shoot
that bird with a gun,

1065
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:49,700
you are an expert marksman and
deserve the delicious and tiny

1066
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,480
treat that you've then blown
apart with your bullet--

1067
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1068
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,970
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, exactly.

1069
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:59,120
So you can you know rain
bird dust on whatever meal

1070
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,770
you've already prepared.

1071
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:03,290
That's what I like in finding
these radiation damage

1072
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:04,753
defects too.

1073
00:47:04,753 --> 00:47:06,170
Because some
experiments have been

1074
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:10,580
done to plot the number of
defects versus their size.

1075
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:13,670
And as the defects get bigger,
the number of them decrease.

1076
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:17,960
So most defects are very, very
small, and it turns out that--

1077
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,168
first of all, the resolution
of the screen is funny.

1078
00:47:21,168 --> 00:47:22,460
I think I know how to fix that.

1079
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:28,490
Clone the screen and then
jump back to presenter mode.

1080
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:31,350
That usually-- that's
not what I wanted.

1081
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:33,810
That's what I wanted, great.

1082
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:36,690
Most of the defects that cause
these reductions in material

1083
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:39,930
properties are too small to
see, even in the transmission

1084
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:42,070
electron microscope.

1085
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:45,490
So I don't have to tell you this
stuff again, that I don't like

1086
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:47,590
the DPA, I showed you that.

1087
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:49,540
What we want is that.

1088
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,070
We took some
inspiration directly

1089
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:52,660
from the Manhattan Project.

1090
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:55,570
Luckily, I have an uncle who
works at the DuPont Library

1091
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:59,740
and Dupont was quite responsible
for the Manhattan Project.

1092
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,200
So this memo between Eugene
Wigner and Leo Szilard--

1093
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,210
one of whom won the Nobel
Prize, the other one

1094
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:05,710
probably should have--

1095
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:08,320
said, hey, radiation
stores energy

1096
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:12,160
by neutron collisions like
cold working and amorphization.

1097
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,160
So we've dug up this original
memo from the 40s, and said,

1098
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,370
let's do this for everything
because every defect has

1099
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:20,500
its unique amount of
energy that it stores

1100
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,570
and creating it in
some different amount

1101
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:27,120
of eV per defect, and we've
done some molecular dynamics

1102
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,670
simulations to show that
this amount of energy stored

1103
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:31,200
is pretty universal.

1104
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,140
When you irradiate something, we
predict that it stores about 2%

1105
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,832
of its energy in
radiation defense.

1106
00:48:36,832 --> 00:48:38,790
So if you know the number
of neutrons that hit,

1107
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,340
and you know that the amount
of energy per neutron,

1108
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,480
you know how much
you're looking for.

1109
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,900
You know what your
signal should be.

1110
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,650
And to jump through to the whole
idea of differential scanning

1111
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:52,450
calorimetry, it's
like what I drew here,

1112
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:54,190
but a lot more legible.

1113
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:56,920
You simply heat two
materials, one of which

1114
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,800
contains your sample,
measure their temperature,

1115
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,830
and look how much energy it
takes between them to keep them

1116
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:04,870
at the same temperature.

1117
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:06,505
We did some of
these measurements

1118
00:49:06,505 --> 00:49:08,380
on a piece of steel from
the nuclear reactor,

1119
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,005
and we got a whole
bunch of interesting

1120
00:49:10,005 --> 00:49:12,502
looking peaks for the
red curve compared

1121
00:49:12,502 --> 00:49:14,710
to the blue curve in the
other irradiated conditions,

1122
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:16,990
so we think there's
something there.

1123
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:19,750
So we tried a more controlled
experiment irradiating

1124
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:22,300
aluminum with helium
ions and the accelerator

1125
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,420
in Northwest 13.

1126
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:27,250
And we were encouraged
because the initial time

1127
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:30,070
that we heated this material,
we got some stored energy

1128
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:32,260
out of it in some funky
spectrum that might tell us

1129
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,910
what the defects are.

1130
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:36,990
The bad news is we got that
with the control heat too,

1131
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:39,472
and the really bad news
is that when you normalize

1132
00:49:39,472 --> 00:49:40,930
all these curves,
you get something

1133
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:44,520
that you can't tell if I
drew it or my son drew it.

1134
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,200
Looks suspiciously
like the doodles

1135
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,480
that he does, not
scientific data.

1136
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,190
And the problem is that
DSC, differential scanning

1137
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:55,190
calorimetry, induces a lot
of artifacts in the signal

1138
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:58,150
that we couldn't
separate from the noise.

1139
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:00,580
So our solution was to go nano.

1140
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,580
To use a nano a DSC, or
nano differential scanning

1141
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:06,730
calorimeter, that can
heat about 10,000 times

1142
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:09,430
faster than a traditional DSC.

1143
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:12,400
So you can get your energy
out from smaller materials

1144
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,970
way faster than these artifacts
can manifest themselves.

1145
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:17,883
What we think is
going to happen is

1146
00:50:17,883 --> 00:50:19,300
that every one of
these peaks here

1147
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:23,290
is going to correspond to one
type of defect that's released

1148
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:25,090
at a certain temperature.

1149
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:28,990
And by extrapolating, or
say, integrating the area

1150
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:32,410
under those curves, you get the
energy in each type of defect.

1151
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:35,530
And by extrapolating
to a zero heating rate,

1152
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:37,960
you should know which
type of defect they are.

1153
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,820
And if you know which
defects you have

1154
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,850
and how many of each one,
you know the full defect

1155
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:44,500
properties and
material, you should

1156
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,302
know it's material properties.

1157
00:50:46,302 --> 00:50:48,760
Because we already know if you
have this many dislocations,

1158
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:53,060
it's this brittle, the question
is how many dislocations.

1159
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,185
So we start off by--

1160
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:56,810
we use a different
kind of calorimeter.

1161
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:58,760
It actually fits on a chip.

1162
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,500
In fact, there's two on a chip.

1163
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,960
There's one that we
put our material on,

1164
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,750
and one as a reference
that we both put

1165
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:08,450
in the accelerator being
irradiated at the same time

1166
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:10,672
to control for that
effect, and this is

1167
00:51:10,672 --> 00:51:11,880
what they actually look like.

1168
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,370
The scale bar here
is 100 microns,

1169
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:16,880
and that transparent spot
is a little bit of aluminum

1170
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,140
that we vapor deposited
onto the calorimeter.

1171
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,880
Right there.

1172
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,080
And so the way this process
works, is we take our DSC chip,

1173
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:30,470
we put a mask over it,
vaporize some aluminum

1174
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:33,020
to deposit on one
of the calorimeters,

1175
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:37,090
take the mask away, and
irradiate the whole thing,

1176
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:39,930
and then finally put it
in the nanocalorimeter,

1177
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,680
and I'll show you what
happens slowed down

1178
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,240
by a factor of 1,000.

1179
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,500
That pulse right there.

1180
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:48,832
That whole thing just went from
zero to 450c a millisecond.

1181
00:51:48,832 --> 00:51:50,790
And the reason it took
a second is because I've

1182
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:54,180
slowed down the video by
4,000 or by 5,000 times,

1183
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,790
and that little pulse
of heat actually

1184
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:59,550
released some of
the defect energy.

1185
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:02,460
We were able to see very
clearly, the first time we

1186
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,740
heated the sample,
this extra area

1187
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:08,400
corresponds to some
sort of energy release.

1188
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,605
We then heated that same
sample a whole bunch of times,

1189
00:52:11,605 --> 00:52:13,980
and made sure that it was
always the same, which meant we

1190
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:16,940
had a fully relaxed material.

1191
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,493
And it shows some
sort of a trend.

1192
00:52:18,493 --> 00:52:20,660
If you note this data was
taken like two months ago,

1193
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:21,830
it's pretty fresh.

1194
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:24,050
Not published yet, so
hopefully by the time

1195
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:26,250
this video comes
out, it will be.

1196
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:28,250
And we see some sort of
trend between the amount

1197
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:30,542
of irradiation it gives and
the amount of stored energy

1198
00:52:30,542 --> 00:52:31,560
you can get out of it.

1199
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,620
So this is what we hope can be
used instead of those Charpy

1200
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:35,730
coupons.

1201
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:37,710
We can go much, much
smaller and just take out

1202
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:40,890
tiny pieces of the vessel
and get the same information

1203
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:44,790
as you would from a Charpy
test but on the nanoscale.

1204
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:47,680
So the question then is, where
is the defect fingerprints?

1205
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,360
Where are those
individual defects

1206
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,260
that we were looking for?

1207
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:55,520
Well, I think they're just
popping up right here.

1208
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:59,080
The reason for that is we
picked a very fast heating rate

1209
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,870
for our experiments, and doing
these sorts of measurements

1210
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:05,738
on other materials shows that
at 10,000 Kelvin per second--

1211
00:53:05,738 --> 00:53:07,030
think about that for a second--

1212
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:09,570
10,000 Kelvin per second.

1213
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:11,730
So in a millisecond,
something heats up

1214
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:17,210
by 10 K, which is ridiculous.

1215
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:18,440
Yeah, something like that.

1216
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,310
You don't really see any peaks.

1217
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:24,410
The heating is so fast
that the defects don't even

1218
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:27,350
have time to find each other,
annihilate, and release

1219
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:28,670
their stored energy.

1220
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,800
So we need to repeat the
experiments at some lower

1221
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,630
temperatures, see
what the peaks are,

1222
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:36,920
but if you go too low, you
end up getting a lot of noise

1223
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:37,803
in your signal.

1224
00:53:37,803 --> 00:53:40,220
So there's going to be some
sweet spot that we haven't yet

1225
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:43,520
found in order to see
this stored energy.

1226
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,880
So we're just at the very
first experimental stage

1227
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,820
of trying to see can we
extend reactor lifetimes.

1228
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:51,375
After doing
simulations for a year

1229
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:53,000
that probably no one
believes until you

1230
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,270
do an experiment, including me.

1231
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:58,950
But for now, it actually
shows some sort of a trend,

1232
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:01,370
so it's just enough
justification for us

1233
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:02,870
to buy one of these
nanocalorimeters

1234
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:05,158
and start looking for real.

1235
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:07,700
So if you want to see, now I've
taken you from basic material

1236
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,890
science, to where's
the field going to,

1237
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:13,457
how do we keep our reactors
running in about two hours.

1238
00:54:13,457 --> 00:54:15,290
I think that's the most
compact introduction

1239
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:19,110
to nuclear materials I
can possibly give you.

1240
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:21,170
So any questions on
what you've seen today?

1241
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:23,580
AUDIENCE: Is that roughly
the trend you would expect?

1242
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,530
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes,
I would expect an up.

1243
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:27,060
That's the best I can say.

1244
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,990
As far as is it actually a line?

1245
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:30,330
Is it a curve?

1246
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:34,537
I am not as brave or stupid as
some of the other folks that

1247
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:36,870
will draw an arbitrary shaped
line through a single data

1248
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:37,950
point.

1249
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:41,127
So I'm not drawing
a trend line yet.

1250
00:54:41,127 --> 00:54:42,210
Yeah, any other questions?

1251
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:43,190
Yeah?

1252
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:45,630
AUDIENCE: Is it-- or I guess
you're making the assumption

1253
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:48,620
that one little spot in the
reactive pressure vessel

1254
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:53,140
to say what the rest of the
vessel has been exposed to?

1255
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,390
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, not at all.

1256
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:55,980
Take a whole bunch.

1257
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:58,980
Then, instead of just
doing Charpy coupons

1258
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:02,610
of one place, which is what
we do now, you can get a map.

1259
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:04,230
We don't have that
information now,

1260
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:06,230
but if you take pieces
from all over the vessel,

1261
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:09,840
then you get an actual 3D
map instead of a single point

1262
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,340
of saying all right,
well, we picked

1263
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:13,750
what we think is going to
be the worst condition.

1264
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:14,910
How do you know?

1265
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:16,550
You don't.

1266
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:17,890
How do you know for sure?

1267
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:19,265
You make measurements
like these.

1268
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:24,420
Any other questions?

1269
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:24,920
Yeah?

1270
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,260
AUDIENCE: What would
a peak in this graph

1271
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:31,100
correspond to in terms of like--

1272
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:34,640
How does it relate to some
sort of damage effect?

1273
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,640
MICHAEL SHORT: We would
expect that a peak would

1274
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,090
relate to a certain type of
defect reaction occurring.

1275
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:43,060
When some type of defect gets
high enough in temperature

1276
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:47,170
that it goes from stuck to
mobile, and as that moves,

1277
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:49,750
it encounters anything else
it will in the material,

1278
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:52,540
and will react with all
the other defects nearby,

1279
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:54,640
decimating the
population of that defect

1280
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,890
and slightly depressing
that of the others.

1281
00:55:56,890 --> 00:55:58,890
And as you go higher, and
higher in temperature,

1282
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,910
the slower and slower
defects start to move.

1283
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,100
Yeah?

1284
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,892
AUDIENCE: So you can
get rid of the defects

1285
00:56:05,892 --> 00:56:07,545
by heating it quickly?

1286
00:56:07,545 --> 00:56:08,420
MICHAEL SHORT: Mm-hmm

1287
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:12,380
AUDIENCE: Would there be a way
to self repair our radiation

1288
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:14,298
damage to pressure
vessels themselves?

1289
00:56:14,298 --> 00:56:15,840
MICHAEL SHORT: That
would be awesome.

1290
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,310
But the properties of the
vessel are highly dependent on,

1291
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:22,490
not just its composition,
but the heat treatment

1292
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:23,840
that went to make it.

1293
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,310
If you heat that
vessel, you both

1294
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:28,820
remove the radiation damage and
remove the strengthening put

1295
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:32,020
in by the forging
and heating process.

1296
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:34,300
So you would have,
if-- again, if you

1297
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:39,010
let's say, replace the vessel
you have a new reactor.

1298
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:41,590
If you heat the
vessel too much, it's

1299
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:45,590
no longer a code stamp vessel.

1300
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:48,110
Pretty tricky spot
that we're in, huh?

1301
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:51,103
But we're trying to
science our way out of it.

1302
00:56:51,103 --> 00:56:52,520
Well, it's a couple
minutes after.

1303
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:58,300
I don't want to keep you longer,
but I'll open on Thursday

1304
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:01,270
with a little story about
how mass attenuation

1305
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:04,880
coefficients can get you out
of apartheid South Africa.

1306
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,080
I'm serious.

1307
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:10,000
And then we'll move into
dose and biological effects.
