8
00:00:22,195 --> 00:00:24,130
MICHAEL SHORT: I got
an interesting question

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,960
in the anonymous
comment box, and I

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,090
want to see how many
other people agree

11
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,130
with it the comment
when something like,

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,710
is everything in this field
of nuclear science engineering

13
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,067
computational in nature?

14
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,650
Because so far, we've
pretty much just

15
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,277
thrown theory and
simulations at you,

16
00:00:38,277 --> 00:00:39,610
we haven't done any experiments.

17
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:43,465
So who shares this
concern or wonder?

18
00:00:43,465 --> 00:00:45,375
So 1, 2, 3, 4--

19
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:46,670
OK, 5, yeah.

20
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,950
So getting towards
roughly half of you.

21
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,280
So I can confidently
answer, no, this is not

22
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,320
a purely computational field.

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,680
We just had to get you just
enough science and physics

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,050
so that you'd be able to
understand some of the lab

25
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,910
activities that we've got in
store for you, one of whom,

26
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,130
Mike Ames here from
the Nuclear Reactor Lab

27
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,490
is going to be helping
you with-- actually, two

28
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,760
of them he'll be helping with.

29
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,320
MICHAEL AMES: Two?

30
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:09,650
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

31
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,000
Well--

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,610
MICHAEL AMES: --your bananas.

33
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,290
MICHAEL SHORT: The
bananas and the thing

34
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,540
that we dreamed up today, so--

35
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,665
MICHAEL AMES: This morning?

36
00:01:14,665 --> 00:01:15,270
OK.

37
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,580
So you want an intro those--

38
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,030
MICHAEL SHORT: Sure.

39
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,680
MICHAEL AMES: --and
I'll, I don't know--

40
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,820
MICHAEL SHORT: Fill
in what I get wrong.

41
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,362
Also, Mike's going
to talk about what

42
00:01:21,362 --> 00:01:23,780
we're going to do together,
which is called NAA,

43
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,940
or Nuclear Activation Analysis.

44
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,370
There are many, many
ways of measuring

45
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,500
what sort of impurities
may exist in materials,

46
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,450
and this is among
the most sensitive.

47
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,903
We happen to have
a nuclear reactor.

48
00:01:34,903 --> 00:01:36,320
So what we will
be doing, what I'm

49
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,892
going to ask each of you guys
to do for a special assignment

50
00:01:38,892 --> 00:01:41,350
that not graded, except you'll
need it for the problem set,

51
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,180
so it kind of is, is
I want each of you

52
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,810
to bring something into me
that weighs about 50 milligrams

53
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,110
in one piece, fits in
here, is not fissionable--

54
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,185
so if you have uranium at home,
I shouldn't know about it.

55
00:01:54,185 --> 00:01:56,060
And we also ask that
you don't bring anything

56
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,750
in that is too salty, because
sodium activates like crazy.

57
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,360
And each of you, using your
knowledge of radioactive decay

58
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,060
that we learned Tuesday
and today, and the Bateman

59
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,120
equations in serious
radioactive decay next Tuesday

60
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,610
and Thursday are going to
calculate what impurities

61
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,540
exist in your sample.

62
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,730
What is your sample?

63
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,560
It's--

64
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,085
MICHAEL AMES: You're
not going to be

65
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:16,080
able to do the calculations.

66
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,630
MICHAEL SHORT: We're going
to make some estimates of--

67
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,140
MICHAEL AMES: Oh, OK.

68
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,265
MICHAEL SHORT: The isotopes
that you'll let us see.

69
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,340
The shorts, yeah.

70
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,507
I know we're not going to
get every impurity, right?

71
00:02:24,507 --> 00:02:26,298
MICHAEL AMES: Well,
we're not going to able

72
00:02:26,298 --> 00:02:27,478
to run it next week.

73
00:02:27,478 --> 00:02:30,020
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes, but I will
want your materials next week.

74
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,190
OK.

75
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,810
So by Tuesday, I'd
like each of you

76
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,240
to come bring something
in for what you'd

77
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,750
like to know the elemental
composition consisting

78
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,880
of the following elements.

79
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,470
Let's see.

80
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,310
Problem sets, I think
I've got it right up here.

81
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,210
Let me just clone the screen.

82
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,710
So you can see what
we can look for.

83
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,823
So this is provided
to me by Mike.

84
00:02:52,823 --> 00:02:55,240
We're going to do what's called
a short nuclear activation

85
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,640
analysis run looking for any of
the elements up on this list.

86
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,040
Shorts 1 with extremely short
half-lives, and shorts 2

87
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,560
with elements in the
half-lives of hours.

88
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,810
And Mike, I had a question
for you now that we're live.

89
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,570
Can we count arsenic
in that list?

90
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,045
Because it's
24-point-something hours.

91
00:03:13,045 --> 00:03:14,980
MICHAEL AMES: Yeah,
we could do arsenic.

92
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,730
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

93
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,608
MICHAEL AMES: It's not
a great shorts element.

94
00:03:19,608 --> 00:03:21,150
You'd probably have
to have something

95
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,710
with a bunch of arsenic in it.

96
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,210
MICHAEL SHORT: So
if any of you guys

97
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,010
have some food that
you bought online

98
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,020
and you don't know what sort
of contaminants there are,

99
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,812
or if you've got a
piece of your fingernail

100
00:03:29,812 --> 00:03:32,850
and want to see if you
are what you eat, or--

101
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,980
MICHAEL AMES: After
telling you why fingernails

102
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,670
would be a great
sample, we might

103
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,720
run afoul of the human
subjects in research issue

104
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,435
with fingernails.

105
00:03:43,435 --> 00:03:45,185
MICHAEL SHORT: What
about dog fingernails?

106
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:46,295
MICHAEL AMES:
--believe it or don't.

107
00:03:46,295 --> 00:03:47,837
Ah, yes, your dogs
are probably not--

108
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:48,630
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

109
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,370
So clip your pets'
claws if you want

110
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,260
to see if they
are what they eat,

111
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,720
or don't tell me what nail the
thing came from, or get a--

112
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,450
slice up a piece of a peanut or
whatever your favorite food is.

113
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,980
Or if you want to see if
there are any metal dyes used

114
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,285
in your clothing, cut out a
little 50 milligram square,

115
00:04:05,285 --> 00:04:07,410
it'll be like a fashion
statement and an experiment

116
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,390
at the same time, right?

117
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,110
So we ask that it's
about 50 milligrams,

118
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,490
it's gotta fit in here, it's
gotta be not that salty and not

119
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:18,899
fissionable, and we're going to
pack a couple of these in one

120
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,940
of these rabbits, these
polyethylene rabbits.

121
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,340
We call it those, one,
because everything in nuclear

122
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,137
is named after animals and farm
implements for some reason.

123
00:04:26,137 --> 00:04:28,470
Did I go over that with you
guys the first day of class?

124
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,690
Barns, shakes, pigs, rabbits?

125
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,190
OK.

126
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,720
So a rabbit is a little capsule.

127
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,830
Do you pop open or
you screw it open?

128
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,075
Oh yeah, there's like a
square nut at the top.

129
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:42,450
Just a little capsule that
goes through a pneumatic tube,

130
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,580
kind of like the
old bank machines,

131
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,520
and it'll go firing into the
reactor, sit there for a while,

132
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,590
and get pneumatically
sucked back out so that we

133
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,680
can calculate the activation and
decay of the isotopes within.

134
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,070
And a pig is just a
big heavy thing of lead

135
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,240
where you keep pieces
of things that you

136
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,880
irradiated for shielding.

137
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,430
So if you notice the sort
of methodology theme here,

138
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,700
farms, pigs, rabbits,
barns, shakes.

139
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,370
Anyone else you know any
other farmy nuclear units?

140
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,012
Yeah?

141
00:05:09,012 --> 00:05:09,953
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

142
00:05:09,953 --> 00:05:11,370
MICHAEL SHORT: Or
farmy anythings?

143
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,590
AUDIENCE: They follow
the [INAUDIBLE] detectors

144
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,857
toads and bullfrogs.

145
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,690
MICHAEL SHORT: So the
detectors in [? nif ?]

146
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,070
are called toads and bullfrogs.

147
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,933
Why is that?

148
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:22,475
AUDIENCE: Because
the people who made

149
00:05:22,475 --> 00:05:23,933
the acronym
[? like making their ?]

150
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:26,315
acronyms, and [INAUDIBLE]
bullfrog was not [INAUDIBLE]..

151
00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:28,690
MICHAEL SHORT: So actually
bullfrog stands for something.

152
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,050
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

153
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,340
MICHAEL SHORT:
That's pretty cool.

154
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:30,840
OK.

155
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
acronyms are [INAUDIBLE]

156
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,885
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

157
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:39,062
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
acronym for acronym.

158
00:05:39,062 --> 00:05:41,020
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh yes,
the acronym for acronym.

159
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,228
As well as what I study,
which is CRUD or Chock River

160
00:05:43,228 --> 00:05:44,380
Unidentified Deposits.

161
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,758
It's the gunk that
builds up on fuel rods.

162
00:05:46,758 --> 00:05:48,550
Well, I talked to a
fellow from Chock River

163
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,140
who took extreme offense
to this detriment

164
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,900
to nuclear power
plants being attributed

165
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,668
to his fine laboratory.

166
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:56,710
MICHAEL AMES: Oh, I thought
it was chromium-rich.

167
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,377
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh,
see, that would work,

168
00:05:58,377 --> 00:06:00,310
but they're not
actually chromium-rich.

169
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:00,950
Yeah.

170
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,450
Cool.

171
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,710
So Mike, do you want
to say anything else?

172
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,502
MICHAEL AMES: Yeah.

173
00:06:03,502 --> 00:06:07,240
I think I want to say-- so yeah.

174
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,930
So--

175
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,080
MICHAEL SHORT: You want to
introduce yourself, too?

176
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,247
MICHAEL AMES: Oh yes, sorry.

177
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:10,980
I'm Mike Ames.

178
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,330
I work over at the
Nuclear Reactor Lab mostly

179
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:19,320
doing nuclear experiments, but
I also run the NAA lab there.

180
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,200
And I've been doing
it for a while.

181
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,620
So the idea-- the reason
we've got these guys,

182
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,060
it'll irradiate the
samples in this.

183
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,270
The easiest thing for
me to do without losing

184
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,460
any of your samples is
[INAUDIBLE] [? there, ?]

185
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,730
something gets radiated in
this, I slip the top off,

186
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,620
and you probably can't see that,
but it's for a little poly bag.

187
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,790
I'll dump your sample
into the poly bag.

188
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:47,320
So it's something that's like
one piece that works the best.

189
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,070
What I usually tell
people, it's something

190
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,920
that you could
pick up reasonably

191
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,913
easily with a pair of tweezers.

192
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,580
That way if they drop
it, I can actually

193
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,990
pick it up with tweeers.

194
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,970
But that kind of
gives you a good size.

195
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,510
No-- nothing to powdery,
because the powder

196
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:07,090
is going to spread around
and then get contaminations.

197
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,358
Yeah, and that list there, I
guess you said you posted it.

198
00:07:10,358 --> 00:07:11,150
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

199
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,280
The list has posted
on the Stellar site.

200
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,322
MICHAEL AMES: Yeah, yeah.

201
00:07:14,322 --> 00:07:16,940
So yeah, we'll see mostly
these light elements,

202
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,000
the guys with the astericies.

203
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,270
I don't see that well.

204
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,410
Yeah, gallium I'm probably
not going to see that.

205
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:24,910
So--

206
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,140
MICHAEL SHORT: Interesting,
we found gallium

207
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,550
in your dog claws or something.

208
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,370
MICHAEL AMES: Yeah, magnesium,
aluminum, titanium, vanadium,

209
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,752
those are easy.

210
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:33,460
Sodium, chloride, and
potassium are easy.

211
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,580
The manganese will
come out nicely.

212
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,370
Some of the elements of--

213
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,840
generally more interest
down-- further down--

214
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,600
MICHAEL SHORT: Even further--

215
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,390
MICHAEL AMES: --chromium,
those have longer half-lives,

216
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,880
so I'm going to see those.

217
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,990
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

218
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,340
MICHAEL AMES: Probably do like
a five or 10-minute irradiation,

219
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,910
let it decay for a little
while, and then we'll

220
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,540
do a couple of counts.

221
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,318
Have you ever get
over to the reactor?

222
00:07:58,318 --> 00:08:00,110
MICHAEL SHORT: We will
be there a fair bit.

223
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,040
MICHAEL AMES: OK, you guys are
going to be there next week.

224
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,873
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

225
00:08:01,873 --> 00:08:04,573
So what do you
usually use NAA for?

226
00:08:04,573 --> 00:08:05,990
MICHAEL AMES: NAA,
well, the thing

227
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,560
we've been using it for lately
a lot is anything that's

228
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,660
going to go in the
core of the reactor,

229
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:16,880
we want to analyze to see if
there's any surprise elements--

230
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,732
to see how much cobalt
is in a piece of steel

231
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,440
that we're going to
put in because people

232
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,820
don't usually
measure the cobalt,

233
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,400
but it activates really well.

234
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,870
And so that causes
problems later

235
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,640
on when we have to
take some compartments

236
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,910
for cobalt-60 or half
the M that shows up

237
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,047
and things that you
don't expect it.

238
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,450
MICHAEL SHORT: Mm-hmm.

239
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,360
MICHAEL AMES: My past
in doing NAA was all

240
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,039
environmental samples.

241
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,559
So we did a lot
of trace element,

242
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,930
heavy metal chemistry on
atmospheric particulates,

243
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:55,340
rain water, ice cores, lake
sediments, crude oil, coal,

244
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,670
fly ash.

245
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,940
And so we would measure
that whole stack

246
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,617
of elements and those guys
for environmental studies.

247
00:09:01,617 --> 00:09:02,450
MICHAEL SHORT: Cool.

248
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,550
MICHAEL AMES: That
was my time doing NAA.

249
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,050
I don't know, I
think that's enough.

250
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,400
You want me back here
next Tuesday or Thursday--

251
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,540
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, to
explain a little bit more

252
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,820
of the specifics of the process.

253
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,737
MICHAEL AMES: --give you
the five, 10 minutes.

254
00:09:12,737 --> 00:09:14,420
And if you guys could--

255
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,770
I mean, are you guys can
be able to come to the lab

256
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,788
when we do the shorts?

257
00:09:17,788 --> 00:09:19,580
MICHAEL SHORT: Depends
on when you do them.

258
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,640
If it's early
November, then yes.

259
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,850
MICHAEL AMES: Yeah, OK.

260
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,483
So when I do shorts, I put two
samples in one of these guys,

261
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,150
they'll shlink into
the reactor and out.

262
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,220
MICHAEL SHORT: Which
you guys should see.

263
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,270
It's pretty cool.

264
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,080
MICHAEL AMES: Yeah, you
can watch that part.

265
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,550
And then I run it
down the hallway

266
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,250
and throw each
sample on a detector.

267
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,580
And while those samples are
counting, I run another rabbit.

268
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,490
So it's kind of an all-day thing
running up and down the hall

269
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,470
every half hour.

270
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,570
So you could almost come
anytime during the day

271
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:51,799
while I'm running these and get
one full round in half an hour.

272
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,632
MICHAEL SHORT: Cool.

273
00:09:52,632 --> 00:09:54,090
MICHAEL AMES: I think
that's the whole story.

274
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,050
You can hang on to
that if you want.

275
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:55,430
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

276
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,940
Thanks, Mike.

277
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,960
So you heard the charge.

278
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,710
Bring me your dog claws, your
eyebrows, your skin flakes,

279
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,610
your scabs, your--

280
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:01,990
MICHAEL AMES: Oh yeah, can we--

281
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,710
MICHAEL SHORT: --food pieces--

282
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,860
MICHAEL AMES: --from hair?

283
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,420
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh
Yeah, so no hair.

284
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,730
MICHAEL AMES: We used to do
a bunch of hair analysis.

285
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,810
Hair is a pain in
the neck because it--

286
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,810
MICHAEL SHORT: Staticky?

287
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,310
MICHAEL AMES:
--clings to everything

288
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,890
and it gets stuck to parts.

289
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,520
Yeah, we did some hair
analysis for the superfund site

290
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,750
in Woburn, and it
was a big success,

291
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,730
but it was not pleasant
to do the work.

292
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,680
MICHAEL SHORT: So don't
bring us your hair,

293
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,230
but bring us your skin flakes,
your scabs, your dog claws,

294
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,310
your food scraps, your--

295
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,270
MICHAEL AMES: No skin flakes.

296
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,590
MICHAEL SHORT: Just
don't tell him.

297
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,007
MICHAEL AMES: Stuff
that you can--

298
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,365
like I said, something
that's like one good piece

299
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:35,600
that you can pick it up--

300
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,185
MICHAEL SHORT:
Yeah, get creative.

301
00:10:36,185 --> 00:10:37,227
MICHAEL AMES: --be great.

302
00:10:37,227 --> 00:10:39,920
MICHAEL SHORT: It doesn't have
to be something that I said.

303
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,628
As long as it's not
fissionable or salty.

304
00:10:41,628 --> 00:10:43,430
MICHAEL AMES: And we
might veto samples--

305
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:47,240
I do need to know what they
are roughly before we throw it

306
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,427
in the reactor, and we might
end up vetoing some samples.

307
00:10:50,427 --> 00:10:51,260
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

308
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,760
So let's figure
it out by Tuesday.

309
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,135
That way if we have to veto,
we have a while for you guys

310
00:10:55,135 --> 00:10:56,290
to find another sample.

311
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,290
MICHAEL AMES: Or-- yeah.

312
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,708
I don't know if I'll be able
to run a sample from everybody.

313
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:01,750
MICHAEL SHORT: We'll see.

314
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,470
MICHAEL AMES: We'll see.

315
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,130
MICHAEL SHORT: We'll
see what we can do.

316
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,040
MICHAEL AMES: Anyway, I'll
see you all next week.

317
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,687
MICHAEL SHORT: Thanks, Mike.

318
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:07,270
So yeah, so Mike's
going to be helping

319
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,150
us do some nuclear activation
analysis, and in addition,

320
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,650
next week we're
going to be counting

321
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,230
our big bag of burnt bananas,
because now that you're

322
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,480
learning about radioactivity,
and this-- when

323
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,340
we go over activity
and series decay,

324
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,900
you'll have enough
of the science

325
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,670
to understand to
calculate how to what

326
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,350
is the radioactivity
of one banana.

327
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,630
And to do so, we
need like 500 bananas

328
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,670
to get enough statistics.

329
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,420
So we'll be going to
the reactor for that.

330
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,360
We've also set it up so
that next week and the week

331
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,490
afterwards you guys are going
to be manipulating the power

332
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,550
levels of the reactor.

333
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,730
So you'll actually get to
sit in the control seat,

334
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,590
raise and lower
the control rods,

335
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,390
and watch the power
of the reactor change

336
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,490
in ways you probably
won't expect unless you're

337
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,240
getting operator training.

338
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,750
And all of that stuff is
going to be used in the lab

339
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,640
components of the problem sets.

340
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,140
So you guys might
have noticed there

341
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,960
was some spinthariscope
scope thing on problem set 3.

342
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,430
Radiation protection
did not want

343
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,370
me taking smoke detectors apart
and giving them all to you

344
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,070
because that's distributing
open radiation sources

345
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,025
and I probably
shouldn't do that,

346
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:03,400
but we've got
plenty of lab stuff

347
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,770
for you to do to
see what is actually

348
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,570
hands-on in this field.

349
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,760
And if you do want to know
what else is hands-on,

350
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,677
I have an experimental
group and you're always

351
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:13,870
welcome to come see
what we do at the lab.

352
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,690
There usually isn't an
explosion happening,

353
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,660
but there's usually
something that 1,000 to 1500

354
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,750
Celsius temperature,
blue uranium fluoride

355
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,550
salts, nanonewton forces,
extreme pressures, or what

356
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,700
have you, we do a lot of it.

357
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,520
So I wanted to give a quick
review of where we were

358
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,460
in radioactive decay last time.

359
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,100
I think we left off somewhere
around "Particle Physics

360
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,620
Telescope Explodes" was my
favorite BBC headline ever

361
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,370
when we were talking
about-- we've already

362
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:50,260
gone over alpha decay,
we've gone over beta decay,

363
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,960
we started talking
about positron decay

364
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,100
and the neutrinos
that come out of that,

365
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,840
and this Kamiokande
detector that

366
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,480
is set up with lots of
expensive phototubes

367
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,130
to detect the
cones of light left

368
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:07,240
as neutrinos pass faster than
the speed of light in water

369
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,320
through water.

370
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,340
And then there is my
favorite headline.

371
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:17,030
I believe we made it up to the
end of positron annihilation

372
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,430
spectroscopy or ways
that you can actually

373
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,160
use positron emission
to look at the number

374
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,230
and types of atomic defects
in crystalline materials.

375
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,770
And yep, that's where we
left off, interested in PAS?

376
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,730
Lots of papers to check out.

377
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,760
In the meantime,
let's look at one

378
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,090
of the competing mechanisms
for positron emission, which

379
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,880
is electron capture.

380
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,980
In this case-- so
I will warn you,

381
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,840
it's sometimes a little
easy to get mixed up

382
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,570
between electron capture,
internal conversion,

383
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,480
isometric transition, so I've
left these slides on here,

384
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,030
and I also took pictures
of the board from last time

385
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,577
and posted them on
the Stellar site.

386
00:13:53,577 --> 00:13:55,660
So all the blackboards
where we filled the boards,

387
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,020
there's pictures of those.

388
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,100
And I'm going to
keep doing that.

389
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,767
So if you've learned better just
by looking and listening rather

390
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:02,680
than writing
everything, feel free.

391
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,660
If you want to write stuff
down, also feel free.

392
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,480
So an electron capture,
another way of,

393
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,140
well, destroying positive
charge would be for the nucleus

394
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,520
to capture an electron.

395
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,620
So either it can
emit a positron,

396
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,600
giving away some
positive charge,

397
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,243
or it can capture an
electron, destroying

398
00:14:20,243 --> 00:14:21,410
one of the positive charges.

399
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,160
And in each case here, we've got
a proton that becomes a neutron

400
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,090
and something.

401
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:29,210
I'm won't be specific as to
which one because positron

402
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,600
and electron capture, well,
two different but similar kind

403
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,100
of decaying mechanisms.

404
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,740
And then what you
get is this hole

405
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,910
where the electron used to be.

406
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,670
And that's not a very
stable configuration

407
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:44,390
for an atom to have, let's say,
one fewer electron then protons

408
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,730
and especially to have a
hole in the inner shell.

409
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,490
So you get this cascade from
straight-up from high school

410
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:53,330
chemistry of electrons falling
from one shell to the next

411
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,730
and giving off
characteristic X-rays--

412
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,650
that's me that cross
that out there--

413
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,240
because you will
find misinformation

414
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,430
all over the place
online, and someone

415
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,980
might make a great
figure and mislabel

416
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,040
an electron-emitted photon
as a gamma ray, and remember,

417
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,320
we said gammas come
from the nucleus,

418
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,098
otherwise they're
indistinguishable photons.

419
00:15:12,098 --> 00:15:13,640
And so in electron
capture, you don't

420
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,347
need much of an
energy difference

421
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:17,930
between the parents
and the daughters,

422
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:23,090
unlike positron decay where
for positron decay to happen,

423
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,550
you have to have
Q at least equal

424
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:31,660
to 1.022 MeV, which is the
same as 2 times the rest

425
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,220
mass of the electron.

426
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,850
For electron capture, you don't.

427
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,220
This can happen at
just about any energy.

428
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,350
As long as you can overcome
just the binding energy

429
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,450
of the electron,
which is negligible

430
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,090
compared to these sort
of nuclear energy levels.

431
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,110
And so this is the Q equation.

432
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,820
Keep in mind, these deltas
here are excess masses.

433
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,310
So I'll put this up
again, the excess mass

434
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:58,270
is the real mass minus
the terrible approximation

435
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,220
of a nucleide's mass.

436
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,610
And this way, excess mass and
real mass are directly related,

437
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,340
so you could plug
in masses here,

438
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,900
you could plug in
binding energies

439
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:12,040
by making everything with
a minus sign, and so on.

440
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,950
I think I've repeated myself
enough for the Q equation

441
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,860
stuff, would you guys agree?

442
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,590
Yeah, OK.

443
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,980
And so these are actually
two competing mechanisms.

444
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,710
So shown here is the
decay of sodium-22

445
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:28,340
which we don't want to happen in
our nuclear activation analysis

446
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,320
because it gets pretty toasty.

447
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,300
It can either proceed--

448
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,430
there's a kind of hidden
part of the diagram

449
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,710
that I drew in to make
a little more sense.

450
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:41,150
You start off with the nucleus
at 2.8 MeV above the neon

451
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,980
nucleus' energy level.

452
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:48,020
You need 1.022 MeV to create
the positron-electron pair,

453
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,340
at which point you can emit the
positron with a certain energy.

454
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,630
You're left in an excited
state, and the next thing

455
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:58,130
we'll go over is gamma decay
or Isometric Transitions or IT.

456
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,380
That's the next method of
decay we'll talk about.

457
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,560
Or the nucleus can just
capture an electron,

458
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,900
getting to that
same energy level

459
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,579
and emitting the same gamma ray.

460
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:12,210
So these are two competing
mechanisms of decay.

461
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,839
And then you might
ask, well, when

462
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,750
is one going to happen
and not the other?

463
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,520
Well chances are,
the lower energy

464
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,240
that transition is, the
more likely electron

465
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,510
capture is going to happen.

466
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,990
So when you look at
these energy diagrams,

467
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,690
you can see that as the
transitions get bigger,

468
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:33,300
the probability of positron
decay goes up and up and up.

469
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,250
So you need 1.022 MeV to make
the positron an electron,

470
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:42,030
but the probability of positron
decay very close to this

471
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,310
is fairly low.

472
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,620
Possible, but unlikely.

473
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,620
Is everyone clear on these
two competing mechanisms?

474
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,720
So one way of reducing
the number of protons

475
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,578
is emit a positron, another
is gobble up an electron.

476
00:17:55,578 --> 00:17:57,620
In the end, they make the
same daughter products,

477
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,690
but they go by
different mechanisms.

478
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,490
And they give off
different bits of radiation

479
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:06,075
which we can actually
sense and measure.

480
00:18:06,075 --> 00:18:07,970
Cool.

481
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,690
So on to gamma decay or
isometric transition.

482
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,850
These range from
the dead simple,

483
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,120
like technetium-99
metastable giving off

484
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,630
a characteristic 140 keV
gamma ray for technetium,

485
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,130
that's the medical
imaging procedure

486
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,345
we've talked a lot about.

487
00:18:22,345 --> 00:18:26,710
To the ridiculously
complex, like americium-241,

488
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:29,980
which has a lot, a lot, a lot
of different nuclear energy

489
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:34,030
states, all of which
release anywhere between 1

490
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,500
and a lot of gamma rays.

491
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,920
And this is what's referred
to as isometric transition.

492
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,700
So we'll say gamma or
isometric transition

493
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,810
is like the same thing, they're
just different words for it.

494
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,950
These are called isomers.

495
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,300
They've got the same number
of protons and neutrons,

496
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,770
so it's the same nuclide,
but at an excited state.

497
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,660
And we call it gamma
decay because we

498
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,170
emit gamma rays or photons.

499
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,810
I think this one is the
easiest one to understand,

500
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,990
because the reaction
goes something like--

501
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,490
let's say we have
a parent nucleus

502
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,310
with Z protons and A neutrons.

503
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,950
Nothing happens.

504
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,640
It's about the easiest
nuclear reaction there is.

505
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,820
Except you do give
off a gamma ray.

506
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,280
And we'll usually put
a star or something

507
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,680
to denote an excited state.

508
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,640
So when you see a star
in the reading over there

509
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,920
on a nuclide where
the charge would be,

510
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,990
that's an excited energy
state that will likely

511
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:41,220
decay by IT or gamma decay.

512
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,490
There is also a
competing mechanism

513
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:47,640
for isometric transition
or gamma decay,

514
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,700
and that's what's called
internal conversion.

515
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,293
In this case you
can kind of think

516
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:54,460
of it-- this isn't the
correct physical explanation,

517
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,150
but it's a perfectly
good mental model,

518
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,980
that the gamma ray
would either just

519
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,130
be emitted from the nucleus, at
which point you would see it,

520
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,680
and the energy of the gamma
is the same as that Q,

521
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,010
or it kind of hits an
electron on its way out,

522
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,990
ejecting that electron.

523
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,180
So instead of
finding a gamma ray,

524
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,900
you may just get an electron
emitted at an energy very, very

525
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,880
close to that gamma ray.

526
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,850
The difference between the gamma
ray energy and the electron

527
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,970
energy is its binding energy.

528
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,530
Because if a gamma hits an
electron on the way out,

529
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,010
it has to overcome the binding
energy of that electron,

530
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,600
at which point the
rest of the energy

531
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,460
is just its kinetic energy.

532
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,970
So again, I don't think that's
the precise physical mechanism,

533
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,880
but it's a perfectly good mental
model to remember what this is.

534
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,370
A gamma can either
just get out on its own

535
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:45,650
or it can hit an
electron on its way out.

536
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,690
If you hit the electron
on your way out,

537
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:50,030
just like in electron
capture, then

538
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:56,020
you get a larger shell electron
falling down to the inner shell

539
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,530
emitting an X-ray
just like before.

540
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:01,450
And then there's
one other process

541
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,860
I want you guys to be aware of.

542
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,380
Has anyone here ever heard
of Auger electron emission?

543
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,680
Er, yeah.

544
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,710
So in this case, instead
of sending out an X-ray,

545
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,400
you can think of it like
the X-ray kind of hits

546
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,010
the-- another electron
on its way out.

547
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,810
That's not the actual
process that happens,

548
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,640
but let's just think
of it like that.

549
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,800
And then that electron
is ejected usually

550
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,580
from a much outer shell.

551
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,770
And we can actually use
these Auger electrons

552
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,770
because they have specific
but very low binding

553
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:35,140
energies to do
imaging and elemental

554
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,410
analysis of materials.

555
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,243
So this is another one
of those things where

556
00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:41,290
the stuff you're learning today
is used in an Auger electron

557
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:44,650
microscope up and Building
13 to do combined imaging

558
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,970
and elemental
analysis of materials.

559
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,570
I want to skip back a
sec, because let's say

560
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,540
we have this decay diagram
right here, a pretty simple one.

561
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,480
Cesium-137, that
isotope that everyone

562
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,050
was worried about from the
release from Fukushima.

563
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:05,010
Can either proceed
by just beta decay,

564
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:08,460
or beta decay followed by
an isometric transition.

565
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,310
And shown here is a spectrum
of all the different electron

566
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,200
energies that you'll get out.

567
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,960
If you remember from last
time when we talked about,

568
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,270
let's see, the energy of a beta
particle emitted versus let's

569
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:26,150
say the number of those
particles emitted,

570
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:30,080
if this is the Q value
for that reaction,

571
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,110
you don't always get
a beta particle out

572
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,870
at the Q value-- in
fact, you never do.

573
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:40,270
It looks something
like this, where

574
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:44,290
they'll be some,
let's say, average

575
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:49,510
or some most likely beta energy,
which is about one-third Q.

576
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:53,000
Depends on the reaction, but
that's a good rule of thumb.

577
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,910
So if you've got a
1.174 MeV beta particle,

578
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,970
you're going to see a spectrum
of electron energies ranging

579
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:04,450
from 0 to 1.174.

580
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,700
And you've got this
other beta transition

581
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,950
possible at about
half an MeV, so you're

582
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,927
going to see that same
spectrum right there.

583
00:23:11,927 --> 00:23:14,260
And then there's these two,
what's called the conversion

584
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,460
electrons.

585
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,117
That's evidence of the competing
process with gamma decay.

586
00:23:19,117 --> 00:23:21,700
Which is to say that this gamma
decay can either just get out,

587
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,460
at which point you see a
gamma ray of that energy,

588
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,310
or that gamma hits an
electron on its way

589
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:30,402
out, knocking those
electrons out.

590
00:23:30,402 --> 00:23:33,180
Does anyone know here what it
means by K-shell or L-shell?

591
00:23:36,462 --> 00:23:37,670
If you do, just shout it out.

592
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,120
So that there depends on the--

593
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,220
oh, that's correct.

594
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,390
It's the energy level.

595
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:49,450
So let's say we'll draw kind
of a bore model of a nucleus,

596
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:55,710
we'll call it N. And let's
give it three electron energy

597
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,750
levels.

598
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,750
And let's say there's a couple
electrons in the first shell

599
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,690
and some electrons
in the outer shells.

600
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:11,020
And let's say this electron
was struck on its way

601
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,330
out by a gamma ray.

602
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,770
So it's gone.

603
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:17,320
At this point, you might
have an electron fall

604
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:22,480
from let's call this
level 2 to level 1.

605
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,980
And so this 2-to-1 transition
is called the K-transition.

606
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,530
Don't ask me why the letters
are the way they are.

607
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,690
I probably have read it
and have forgotten it

608
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,310
because it wasn't
that intuitive,

609
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,922
but this is referred
to as a K-transition.

610
00:24:37,922 --> 00:24:39,630
So you may have what's
called the K-alpha

611
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,310
or a K-beta line,
that depends on

612
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,830
if you have an even
higher energy shell,

613
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:47,670
but whatever this letter is, it
tells you what an energy level

614
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:50,070
the electron is going to.

615
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,880
So the K lines would be here.

616
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,530
The L-line-- yeah, I'm sorry.

617
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,990
Let me back up and
say that again.

618
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:01,340
So the idea here is
that if this the--

619
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,760
but let's see.

620
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,510
Which one is this?

621
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,130
0.662.

622
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:08,040
So if the gamma ray
is at 0.662 MeV, which

623
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,970
would be about there, notice
that these K-shell and L-shell

624
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,378
lines aren't quite 0.662.

625
00:25:15,378 --> 00:25:17,670
That's because they have to
overcome the binding energy

626
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:20,530
of the electron to get out.

627
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:23,700
So to jump back to this
diagram right here,

628
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,550
the gamma ray loses a
little bit of energy

629
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,890
in freeing the electron,
the rest of which

630
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,050
can become kinetic
energy, which is

631
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,940
why you can see that
the electron, let's say,

632
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,570
was ejected from
the K-shell here.

633
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,645
And-- yeah?

634
00:25:36,645 --> 00:25:38,895
AUDIENCE: So internal
conversion is the actual process

635
00:25:38,895 --> 00:25:40,978
of-- when we figure out
the process of a gamma ray

636
00:25:40,978 --> 00:25:42,815
hitting the electron?

637
00:25:42,815 --> 00:25:44,940
MICHAEL SHORT: I will say
that internal conversion,

638
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,100
you can imagine a mental
model of the gamma ray

639
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,530
hits an electron on its way out.

640
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,570
AUDIENCE: But it's not
the actual-- that's

641
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,850
not physically happening?

642
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,330
MICHAEL SHORT: Physically
it's more complicated.

643
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:52,930
AUDIENCE: OK.

644
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:53,290
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

645
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,570
AUDIENCE: Looks
like a [INAUDIBLE]..

646
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,036
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

647
00:25:55,036 --> 00:25:55,536
Yep.

648
00:25:55,536 --> 00:25:57,320
So if you want remember
like what's what,

649
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,510
I would say, just remember
this diagram right here.

650
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,140
Yeah, Kristen?

651
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,932
AUDIENCE: You get a gamma
ray and an electron or just

652
00:26:02,932 --> 00:26:03,380
the one--

653
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,430
MICHAEL SHORT: Just
the-- you get just

654
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,080
the electron, good question.

655
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,390
Is the gamma ray is
effectively absorbed

656
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:11,180
in freeing the electron
from its bound shell

657
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,300
and then imparting
kinetic energy.

658
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:13,900
Yep?

659
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,420
AUDIENCE: Is the
Auger emission is

660
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,975
when another electron
hops down an energy level

661
00:26:18,975 --> 00:26:20,263
and that [INAUDIBLE] electron?

662
00:26:20,263 --> 00:26:21,430
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

663
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,800
So that's correct.

664
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,540
So I'll spend the
next couple of slides

665
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,300
going over what Auger
electron emission is,

666
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,120
but not till we finish the
easier stuff, because Auger

667
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,530
is a little complicated.

668
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:36,040
Did I see another
question out here?

669
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,540
Cool.

670
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,510
So again, all the competing
methods for gamma decay,

671
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:42,510
one, the gamma can just
get out; two, the gamma

672
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,240
can knock out an
electron from, let's say,

673
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,410
the K-shell or the L-shell or
the M-shell and so on and so on

674
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,878
depending on what
elements you have.

675
00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:52,920
So I'll just label these.

676
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,016
Like this would be
like the K-shell,

677
00:26:55,016 --> 00:26:57,810
this would be the L-shell,
this would be the M-shell.

678
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,390
Now I want you to
notice something, too.

679
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:07,820
The K-shell electron ejected
from the innermost electron

680
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,560
is slightly lower than
the L-shell electron.

681
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,850
Why do you guys think that is?

682
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:22,010
Let's look at the energetics
for this process, right?

683
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,920
The electron energy level is
whatever the gamma ray level

684
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,560
is minus the binding energy.

685
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,140
Which of these two electrons,
the K-shell or the L-shell,

686
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,090
do you think is going to
be more tightly-bound?

687
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:34,720
The K-shell.

688
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,370
The innermost electron
is more bound,

689
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,730
so it takes away more
energy from that gamma ray.

690
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,380
Let's say this is the gamma.

691
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,800
It takes more energy to eject
an electron from the K-shell

692
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,230
than the L-shell.

693
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,190
Or in other words, the
gamma loses less energy

694
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:51,103
ejecting a less-bound electron.

695
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:52,270
So that's why you see these.

696
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,730
If there were an
M-shell, there--

697
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:57,370
I don't know what element
this was drawn for,

698
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,110
but let's say-- oh, for cesium.

699
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,060
So there probably is an M-shell.

700
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,700
It's just that as you get
down in energy levels,

701
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,770
the probability of
finding an electron

702
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,750
from these outer and
outer energy levels

703
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,090
gets way and way less likely.

704
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,882
So you'll usually just see
a K or an L-shell electron.

705
00:28:12,882 --> 00:28:15,090
And if I asked you to draw
one of these on a problems

706
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,680
set or an exam, just drawing
the K and the L-shells

707
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,487
is perfectly sufficient.

708
00:28:19,487 --> 00:28:21,570
Because that way at least
you'll know that there's

709
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,640
a couple of possibilities.

710
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,140
Yeah?

711
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,310
AUDIENCE: What are the two
curves on the right graph

712
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:25,810
there?

713
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:26,330
MICHAEL SHORT: On this one?

714
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:26,980
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

715
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,397
MICHAEL SHORT: So
these two curves

716
00:28:28,397 --> 00:28:31,360
represent the probability of
finding an electron emitted

717
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,660
at that energy.

718
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,870
So this curve right
here where you

719
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:40,780
get a maximum beta energy of 512
keV comes from that beta decay.

720
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:46,660
And the maximum for the 1.174
comes from this beta decay.

721
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,030
So the total curve
would be the sum

722
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,610
of each of these four things.

723
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,560
If I just said draw
the total probability

724
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,810
of detecting an electron
at that temperature,

725
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,660
you just add those up.

726
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,910
I saw two other questions
or were they the same thing?

727
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,690
Yeah?

728
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:01,428
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
was going to ask

729
00:29:01,428 --> 00:29:02,604
what the [? lower ?]
[INAUDIBLE],,

730
00:29:02,604 --> 00:29:03,930
but his question made me think.

731
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,680
So is it kind of like the
area under both those curves

732
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,054
sums to 1?

733
00:29:08,054 --> 00:29:13,280
Because the probability given
that like 0.512 max is 95% of--

734
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,280
MICHAEL SHORT: Ah.

735
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,510
So the question was is the area
under each of these curves 1?

736
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,028
Not with this scale.

737
00:29:20,028 --> 00:29:22,320
Here we're just showing a
relative number of electrons.

738
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,440
So if you want to find
what's the total probability

739
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,950
that cesium will emit an
electron of each energy,

740
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,680
if you integrate under
all of these curves,

741
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,510
that will sum to 1.

742
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,580
If you're looking at
just one of these decays

743
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,880
and you're saying, if
cesium undergoes this decay,

744
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,640
what's the probability of
each of these energy levels?

745
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,820
Then you only integrate
under the relevant curve.

746
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,040
What's more practical
is usually what's

747
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,960
the probability of
finding any electron

748
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,730
at any energy from cesium?

749
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,730
Then you take into account
all the possible decays,

750
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,640
draw all the curves
independently, add them up,

751
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,080
and you get the
total probability

752
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,960
function whose area will be 1?

753
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,460
Yes?

754
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,362
AUDIENCE: So maybe you could
say that all L-shell electrons

755
00:30:05,362 --> 00:30:08,110
would be ejected if [INAUDIBLE]
in the K-shell due to the fact

756
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,620
that it's less tightly-bound?

757
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,200
MICHAEL SHORT: Wait, can
you say the last part again?

758
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,710
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't we say
the L-shell electron will

759
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,335
be ejected if [INAUDIBLE] energy
in the K-shell due to the fact

760
00:30:15,335 --> 00:30:16,680
that it's not as tightly-bound?

761
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,930
MICHAEL SHORT: That's correct.

762
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:21,030
So the L-shell electron
in the second shell

763
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:24,030
is less tightly-bound than
the first one, which is why

764
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,830
it's ejected with more energy.

765
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,290
It doesn't take as much of the
gamma's energy to get it out.

766
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:33,110
If you were to get, let's say,
the outermost electron ejected,

767
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:36,610
which happens and Auger,
which we'll go over next,

768
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:40,057
it can take up anywhere
from 1 to 7 eV.

769
00:30:40,057 --> 00:30:41,140
Really, really low energy.

770
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,680
That's what we call the work
function or the energy required

771
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,190
to make the outermost
electron out.

772
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:51,040
So any other questions on this
before I go Auger and show you

773
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,640
that process?

774
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,640
Cool.

775
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,860
So then let's get into what
is Auger electron emission?

776
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,650
It's exactly-- Luke,
is that what you said?

777
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:02,825
Were you asking about it?

778
00:31:02,825 --> 00:31:03,450
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

779
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:06,060
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah So it's
exactly like what Luke said.

780
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:10,110
Normally if you have a hole
in a lower-level energy shell,

781
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:13,350
an electron from a higher shell
will fall down to fill it,

782
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,730
emitting an X-ray.

783
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:18,900
A competing process for
this is another electron

784
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:23,460
from a very similar energy
shell will get ejected instead.

785
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,393
The mental model for
this, which again, is not

786
00:31:25,393 --> 00:31:27,810
the true physical picture but
it's perfectly fine to think

787
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:31,050
of it like this, the X-ray hits
another electron on its way

788
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,130
out.

789
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:35,750
And you can look at the
energetics accordingly.

790
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:39,540
Where for Auger emission,
let's say the kinetic energy

791
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,550
the Auger electron
is the difference

792
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:45,480
in the final and initial
electron energy states

793
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,670
minus the binding energy
of the Auger electron,

794
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,210
which will usually be very
low, because the Auger

795
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,310
electron that's
emitted is usually one

796
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,900
of the outer shell electrons.

797
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,990
So to help make this a
little more concrete,

798
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,740
I wanted to show--

799
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,470
I will do a little calculation
example-- it's just addition,

800
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,760
so it's not that hard.

801
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,200
So let's say we were measuring--

802
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,910
I don't even know what this is.

803
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:10,270
And we started to see some
characteristic Auger electrons

804
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:13,310
for copper, platinum,
carbon, and oxygen.

805
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,510
And the question is, why
do we see oxygen coming out

806
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:20,087
right there at about 501 eV?

807
00:32:20,087 --> 00:32:21,670
Very, very low energy
compared to what

808
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,720
we've been talking about.

809
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,390
We can actually look at the
binding energies of some

810
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:29,690
of the different electrons
in oxygen. Luckily

811
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:33,567
there aren't that many
electrons in oxygen. The first--

812
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:35,150
the only-- well, the
only K electrons,

813
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:38,180
let's say, have a
binding energy of 532 eV,

814
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:41,820
the L1 is 24, and then
the L3's something else,

815
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,300
and one of the other
p orbitals is 7 eV.

816
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,550
And so the formula
is pretty simple.

817
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:50,510
It's just 532 minus 24--

818
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,660
that's the difference between
the final and initial energy

819
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,650
levels--

820
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:58,340
minus the seven to free
that outer electron--

821
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,940
comes to 501 eV, which
is exactly where you

822
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,620
see the Auger line for oxygen.

823
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,220
So when I ask you what are all
the possible things that you

824
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,610
could see during the decay
of something, something,

825
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:15,100
something, if I were
to show you this curve

826
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,120
and ask what's missing,
what would you do?

827
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,510
Where would you draw the
Auger electrons on this curve?

828
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,510
Yep?

829
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:31,468
AUDIENCE: Like almost
on the vertical axis

830
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:32,510
because it's [INAUDIBLE].

831
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,302
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

832
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:36,250
500 eV would be like, I
don't know, one pixel away

833
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,455
on this graph.

834
00:33:37,455 --> 00:33:39,580
But if you want a complete
answer to this question,

835
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:43,390
you've got to take into account
all the possible beta energies

836
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,240
for all the possible
beta decay mechanisms;

837
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,470
all of the possible conversion
electrons for whatever gamma

838
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:53,050
come out-- in this case,
there's only one gamma;

839
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:59,600
and Auger electrons which could
compete with X-ray emission.

840
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,187
So everyone clear on that?

841
00:34:02,187 --> 00:34:02,687
Yeah?

842
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,960
So the question is if
you eject an electron

843
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,420
from one of the inner
shells, does that eventually

844
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,489
create an Auger electron, right?

845
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:24,449
It can.

846
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:25,889
These are competing processes.

847
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:31,170
So to the X-ray can just
escape during that transition,

848
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,659
or we'll assume that it hits
another electron on its way

849
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:35,760
out and emits an Auger electron.

850
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,340
So these are also
competing processes.

851
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,560
So you'll see one or
the other-- in reality,

852
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,462
you'll see a lot of both
with different probabilities.

853
00:34:43,462 --> 00:34:45,420
Because you're usually
not looking at one atom,

854
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,760
it's usually looking at a lot.

855
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,260
Cool.

856
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:54,570
Any other questions on IT
as an isomeric transition

857
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:58,760
or internal conversion or
Auger, what this is all about?

858
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,980
Cool.

859
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,960
Wanted to give
you one note, too.

860
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,950
That these Auger
electrons are really,

861
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:09,790
really low energy, which means
the only ones that get out

862
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:13,720
of the material are in
the top, like, tens or so

863
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,520
nanometers of the material.

864
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,070
So it's a very
surface-sensitive technique.

865
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,020
So if you want to do a
really detailed surface

866
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:24,040
analysis or profiling, you
can scan an electron beam

867
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,220
across the sample and then
collect the Auger electrons

868
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,660
that come out--

869
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,310
skipping ahead to
our calculation--

870
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:33,400
and get an elemental
profile that'll

871
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,002
tell you how much
of each element

872
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:37,210
is where depending on how
many of its Auger electrons

873
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,560
you can count.

874
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,580
And it's pretty-- it's
a pretty cool technique.

875
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,300
There are just machines
that do this now.

876
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,797
Any interest in seeing
one of these at the Center

877
00:35:45,797 --> 00:35:47,380
for Materials Science
and Engineering,

878
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,530
because we could try
to arrange that, too?

879
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:51,990
Cool, OK.

880
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,110
I'll see what I can do.

881
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,640
That'll be fun.

882
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,180
And the last decay that
we haven't talked about

883
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,700
and did not show up in
our generalized decay

884
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,963
diagram from last time.

885
00:36:03,963 --> 00:36:05,630
We did talk about
neutron decay, there's

886
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:09,080
one other one that probably
wouldn't fit on this diagram.

887
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,220
Does anyone know what it is?

888
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,140
Spontaneous fission.

889
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,700
So this can happen--
that's right.

890
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,610
This happens with
very heavy elements.

891
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,620
Then usually the heavier
it is, the less stable

892
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,060
it is, the higher
probability this

893
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,510
is at which the nucleus can once
in a while, it-- nuclei just

894
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,430
explode sometimes.

895
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:30,550
Giving off two fission products,
any number of neutrons--

896
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,040
usually between
1 and 3, a couple

897
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,900
of gamma rays, some
anti-neutrinos,

898
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,645
and a whole bunch
of other crazies.

899
00:36:36,645 --> 00:36:38,770
And so that, of course,
doesn't fit on the diagram,

900
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:41,140
but it is another type
of decay that I'll

901
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,195
ask you guys to analyze
on the homework.

902
00:36:43,195 --> 00:36:45,320
And here's a hint-- you
already analyzed part of it

903
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,660
in problems set 1.

904
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:50,242
I'll ask you to go a little
deeper in problem set 3.

905
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:54,180
So anyone have a
question for myself?

906
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:54,680
Cool.

907
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,930
OK.

908
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,580
Bear with me because
I skipped back

909
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:02,860
to like slide really far away.

910
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,410
Oh cool.

911
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,680
That thing actually works.

912
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,590
Right to the summary.

913
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:09,780
So in summary, the radioactive
decay processes are more--

914
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,730
I think the energetics
are pretty easy.

915
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,400
The formulas aren't that hard
to remember because most of them

916
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,973
are just parents minus
daughters minus something.

917
00:37:16,973 --> 00:37:18,390
But what I do want
you to remember

918
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:21,930
is which mechanisms compete
with which other ones and why.

919
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:26,040
And if I were to tell you,
draw me a spectrum of photons

920
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,550
that you may see from
the decay of caesium-137,

921
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,790
or draw me a spectrum
of electrons,

922
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,960
you'd be able to
draw what that is

923
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,540
so that when you
go do lab number 4

924
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,950
and we count our big
bag of burnt bananas

925
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,950
and you know that there's
potassium-40 in there,

926
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:43,380
you know what peaks
to start looking for.

927
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,990
Because you're not
just going to see--

928
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:49,410
let's do a little
flash-forward to detectors now.

929
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,660
And some other stuff that
nuclear engineers actually

930
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,860
do on a daily basis.

931
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:58,970
Let's say you're counting
the energy of photons

932
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:01,370
as a function of, let's
say, the number of photons

933
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,750
that you count.

934
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,910
You're never-- you're
almost never just

935
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:11,473
going to see a lone
potassium-40 peak like that.

936
00:38:11,473 --> 00:38:13,140
It's very, very rare
that you would just

937
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,582
capture the gamma ray as is.

938
00:38:14,582 --> 00:38:16,290
There's going to be
a lot of other things

939
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,738
that will go into it, which
I'm not going to give away yet

940
00:38:18,738 --> 00:38:20,280
because we're going
to go over photon

941
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,640
interactions in
like a week or two,

942
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,390
but you do have to
think about, well, what

943
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,160
other X-rays might you see?

944
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,310
What if the gamma-- what if
this gamma ray hits an electron

945
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:33,780
on the way out, and then
you end up with some X-rays?

946
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,120
Let's say you might
have some K-level X-rays

947
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,820
and some L-level X-rays
and maybe some Ms?

948
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,255
These could all be
possible as well.

949
00:38:42,255 --> 00:38:43,630
I'll just label
those real quick.

950
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,390
Does anyone know how
to find these energies?

951
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,962
What those X-ray levels are?

952
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,520
Anyone ever heard
of the Lyman series?

953
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:03,240
The emission lines from ionized
hydrogen or anything like that?

954
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,790
That's kind of the
simpler case of it.

955
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:09,920
The idea here is if
you want to figure out

956
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,958
what's the wavelength of light
that's going to be emitted,

957
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:16,250
it'll be that's this thing
called the Rydberg constant,

958
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:21,020
a more complex formula for which
I have in the notes, times 1

959
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,800
over your final
shell squared minus 1

960
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,980
over your initial shell squared.

961
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,680
So the idea here is that
you can look up these--

962
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,630
this Rydberg constant
for any element

963
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,800
that you have, and
there's actually--

964
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,370
there's what's called
an R infinity constant

965
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,340
and I think you
just multiply by Z--

966
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,690
I forget what power it is, but
I will get it for you next time.

967
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,440
And then it's just a
matter of the squares

968
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,110
between the final and
the initial shell levels

969
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:55,730
where n can vary from 1
to theoretically infinity.

970
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:59,300
Realistically I've never heard
of anything beyond a g orbital,

971
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,832
so let's just say it's that.

972
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:01,790
Or something like that.

973
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,640
I'll leave the infinity there.

974
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,380
That's technically correct.

975
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,450
OK.

976
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,380
And so all you need to
do is either look up

977
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,990
or calculate this
constant for your element,

978
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:16,180
and then plug-in the
numbers of the shells,

979
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,150
and you know what sort of photon
energy you're going to get out.

980
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,850
And to make that easier
for you, I think now

981
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:25,450
is a good time to introduce
the NIST X-ray tables.

982
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,502
So I want to make sure
you can see my screen.

983
00:40:27,502 --> 00:40:28,960
And I'm going to
show you something

984
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,970
that's on the Stellar
site which will

985
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,890
help you figure this stuff out.

986
00:40:36,466 --> 00:40:38,960
20.2.0.0.1.

987
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,040
Good, you can see.

988
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:46,065
Probably will make log in.

989
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,150
And all the way at the bottom
of the material section,

990
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:59,580
there's the NIST X-ray
Transition Energy Database.

991
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,250
So for example,
you can look at--

992
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,560
I don't know, we were
looking at caesium, right?

993
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,400
Let's find caesium.

994
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,400
And you can start to
look at all transitions--

995
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,090
let's look at the simplest one.

996
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,130
KL1.

997
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:17,400
An electron going from shell
number 2 to shell number 1.

998
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:23,900
Get transitions, and you end up
with a table of these energies

999
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,550
in electron volts.

1000
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,460
So if I were to
ask you, let's say,

1001
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:32,000
what sort of gamma rays might
you see coming off of caesium,

1002
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,090
that would be the most likely
one where you're more likely

1003
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:38,760
to eject an
inner-shell electron,

1004
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,690
and it's most likely that a
number 2 shell electron will

1005
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:45,110
fall down to a number 1 or from
the L-shell to the K-shell,

1006
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,750
whatever you want
to call it, or the--

1007
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,520
some level orbital
to some other--

1008
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,960
there seems to me like
eight different letters

1009
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,265
that describe the same thing.

1010
00:41:52,265 --> 00:41:54,630
I hope you guys get the idea.

1011
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:57,840
If you want to look at all
the possible transitions,

1012
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,905
I have to zoom back out again.

1013
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,900
Yeah.

1014
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,610
Let's just scroll through it.

1015
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:11,410
But what I want you to notice is
that all of the KL transitions

1016
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:14,210
are within like a couple
hundred eV from each other.

1017
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:17,500
So this is like the first
or second or third L-shell

1018
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,200
electron falling to the K-level.

1019
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,560
So they call it
the KL1, KL2, KL3.

1020
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,682
They're all from L-shell.

1021
00:42:24,682 --> 00:42:26,890
They all just might be one
of the different electrons

1022
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:30,080
occupying that shell, which is
why they're not that different.

1023
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:34,720
So if I asked you, draw
all of all of the X-rays

1024
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,310
and gammas coming
out, I don't want

1025
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:38,620
to see a line for
every single level.

1026
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:41,890
I'm very happy for you just
to say, this line represents

1027
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:44,230
the KL series, this
line represents

1028
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:48,420
the KM series, all the things
from shell 3 to shell 1.

1029
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,970
Notice also that
because it's final

1030
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:55,310
minus initial squared,
which I covered up,

1031
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:58,340
falling from an even
further outer shell

1032
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,980
to the same inner shell should
give you a higher energy,

1033
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:05,430
which it does, by like 5 keV.

1034
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:09,860
And then the KN levels,
another 500 eV up.

1035
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,610
They don't have KO's.

1036
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:12,110
Interesting.

1037
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,803
But they have the K-edge.

1038
00:43:13,803 --> 00:43:15,095
Anyone know what the K-edge is?

1039
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:19,980
Exactly.

1040
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:23,520
It's level infinity, which
would mean an electron

1041
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,290
from somewhere else, right?

1042
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:27,870
So this in effect
is like the energy

1043
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:30,780
it takes to ionize a
K-electron or the X-ray

1044
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,150
that you would get from
an electron falling

1045
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,040
all the way into the K-shell.

1046
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,230
So this is your kind
of level infinity.

1047
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:40,450
Notice, it's not that
different from level 5.

1048
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:44,710
That's why I wrote 6, I erased
it for theoretical correctness,

1049
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:48,660
but in all practicality,
you won't see much else.

1050
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,200
Does anyone have a question?

1051
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,310
Thought I saw a hand.

1052
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:52,810
OK.

1053
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:54,550
Let's look at the
L-series-- oh yes?

1054
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:57,019
AUDIENCE: Sometimes you
see L-alpha, L-beta.

1055
00:43:57,019 --> 00:43:57,811
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

1056
00:43:57,811 --> 00:44:01,033
AUDIENCE: Is that the same as
the subscript 1, 2, 3, and 4?

1057
00:44:01,033 --> 00:44:02,575
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
that's another--

1058
00:44:02,575 --> 00:44:04,660
AUDIENCE: --corresponding--
it's just a notation.

1059
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,750
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

1060
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,630
Yeah, there's the
L-alphas, the L-betas,

1061
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:11,290
or you may see L-alpha 1
and 2 in L-beta 1 and 2.

1062
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:14,530
So L designates that it's
going to shell level 2.

1063
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:18,250
Alpha or beta is like LM or LN.

1064
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:22,300
Again, I think I've ranted
about notations before.

1065
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,363
Physics is notorious,
because whoever--

1066
00:44:24,363 --> 00:44:25,780
to describe
something, and it gets

1067
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,990
enough people to infect
with the notation

1068
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:31,060
that you decide it sticks.

1069
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,270
But the main patterns
to look at, then,

1070
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,040
let's say the L1 M whatever.

1071
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,380
This is from level 3 to
level 2, and notice how

1072
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,650
much lower an energy these are.

1073
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:42,490
And the L-edge.

1074
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:46,513
5 keV compared to like 36 keV.

1075
00:44:46,513 --> 00:44:48,430
And all of these sort
of different transitions

1076
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:49,930
you can calculate
with this formula.

1077
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,932
And this has just kind of
tabulated this formula for you.

1078
00:44:52,932 --> 00:44:54,640
So whatever you're
more comfortable doing

1079
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,560
is putting this in Excel, look
it up on NIST, your choice.

1080
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,060
Yeah?

1081
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,643
AUDIENCE: If we were to
calculate that by hand--

1082
00:45:01,643 --> 00:45:02,560
MICHAEL SHORT: Mm-hmm.

1083
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,560
AUDIENCE: --what would
you use for like NF?

1084
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,443
Say, like, 5?

1085
00:45:08,443 --> 00:45:10,610
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, what is
the largest NF, you mean?

1086
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:11,235
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1087
00:45:11,235 --> 00:45:14,400
What numbers actually
go in NF [INAUDIBLE]??

1088
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,190
MICHAEL SHORT: For that I'll put
my practical thing back there.

1089
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:20,840
You'll never see it
much higher than 6

1090
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,460
unless you're talking
about actinides

1091
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:26,570
and super heavy elements with
even crazier shell levels.

1092
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:29,840
But you'll put the
integer shell number,

1093
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:34,240
regardless of whether they
call it L or S or whatever.

1094
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,200
Just put the number
here, and that

1095
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,690
will give you the-- a
pretty good approximation

1096
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:42,178
of the energy transition.

1097
00:45:42,178 --> 00:45:43,970
Does anyone remember
this from high school?

1098
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:45,442
I hope they're
teaching this now.

1099
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:47,130
AUDIENCE: We learned
this in [INAUDIBLE]

1100
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:49,260
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh,
they did in 5-111?

1101
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,260
Oh, that's good to hear.

1102
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:52,520
What about 3-091?

1103
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,800
Anyone take that?

1104
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,550
No one took 3-091?

1105
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:57,660
Wow, OK.

1106
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,900
Usually it's like
half and half or so.

1107
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:00,770
Cool.

1108
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:02,190
And let's see, how
far does it go?

1109
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:05,000
All the way to the L3
N's in the L3 edge.

1110
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,290
So that's the biggest
element they have talking

1111
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:12,690
about ridiculous transitions.

1112
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:16,990
Yeah.

1113
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:20,860
So notice also,
as you go up in--

1114
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,987
that's number 100.

1115
00:46:22,987 --> 00:46:24,570
So this is the
heaviest one they have,

1116
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:27,600
so most likely to have the
largest number of levels.

1117
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,710
So here, the KL1
is like 114 keV,

1118
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:32,480
sometimes
indistinguishable from some

1119
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,930
of these smaller nuclear
energy level transitions.

1120
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:38,720
So remember I said before,
chemistry and nuclear differ

1121
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,520
by about a factor of a million.

1122
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,430
Well, not so if you're
talking about weak gammas

1123
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:47,990
versus heavy elements K-shell
transitions or their K-edges.

1124
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:50,060
Let's see, the largest
X-ray you'd expect

1125
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:55,110
would be the K-edge at 142 keV.

1126
00:46:55,110 --> 00:47:00,060
And the technetium-99 gamma
ray comes out of 140 keV.

1127
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,160
How do you know if it's
a gamma or an X-ray?

1128
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,778
You don't.

1129
00:47:03,778 --> 00:47:06,320
Unless you have really, really
good energy resolution and you

1130
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,460
can tell them apart.

1131
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:07,960
Yeah?

1132
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,460
AUDIENCE: This
formula in this chart

1133
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,922
is only for caluclating
energy of X-rays, right?

1134
00:47:11,922 --> 00:47:12,880
MICHAEL SHORT: Correct.

1135
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,380
This--

1136
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,873
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
for gammas.

1137
00:47:15,873 --> 00:47:17,290
MICHAEL SHORT:
Things get quantum.

1138
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:19,870
So the question was, this
formula and this chart,

1139
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,930
yes, this is only for
X-rays and electron shells.

1140
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:25,750
There are probably
equivalent calculations

1141
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:27,700
for nuclear energy levels.

1142
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:31,930
I will say that's a 22.02
and far beyond topic.

1143
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:34,420
For the nuclear
energy levels, just

1144
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:38,006
use the decay diagrams
to find those.

1145
00:47:38,006 --> 00:47:39,370
Yeah.

1146
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:43,800
The table of nuclides and
all their different diagrams.

1147
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,300
Cool.

1148
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,500
How far do we go here?

1149
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,580
LN-- yep, there's no O's.

1150
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:51,910
So they never talk about
anything beyond shell level 4,

1151
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:52,810
even for fermium.

1152
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:54,658
So ha, I stand corrected.

1153
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:59,314
OK.

1154
00:47:59,314 --> 00:48:01,340
Cool.

1155
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:02,840
So what I wanted
to show you quickly

1156
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,090
is is that series of
hydrogen emission lines.

1157
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,070
So how familiar does
this look to folks?

1158
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:10,950
Where you can have a
transition from level 3

1159
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:14,460
to level 2, level 4 to level
2, and you can actually--

1160
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,180
this is a kind of
neat thing to verify.

1161
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,460
I don't it as a
problem set question

1162
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,110
because it's not
very nuclear, but you

1163
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:22,110
can try this on your own and
verify that you can actually

1164
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:26,250
calculate the expected
wavelength of these photons

1165
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:28,290
coming off of excited hydrogen.

1166
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:30,330
Also notice here,
it goes all the way

1167
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:33,030
out to 9 and out to
infinity, because this

1168
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:35,070
is electronic excitation.

1169
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:37,080
You won't usually get
the ejection of anything

1170
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:41,550
beyond an M or an N electron
even in the largest elements

1171
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:45,080
from, let's say,
from IC-- what is it?

1172
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,735
From internal conversion.

1173
00:48:46,735 --> 00:48:48,110
But you can
electronically excite

1174
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:50,930
them to whatever energy level
to the point of even ionizing

1175
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:51,830
them.

1176
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:54,990
That's where the
infinity comes in.

1177
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:55,490
Cool.

1178
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:57,910
So it's like two of five of.

1179
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:01,340
So I want to open this up to any
questions about decay before we

1180
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:04,760
move upstairs to talk about
activity, half-life, and series

1181
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,210
radioactive decay, which is what
nuclear activation analysis is

1182
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:09,722
all about.

1183
00:49:09,722 --> 00:49:10,430
So anything here?

1184
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:14,506
Yep?

1185
00:49:14,506 --> 00:49:16,381
AUDIENCE: Just making
sure I understand this.

1186
00:49:16,381 --> 00:49:18,841
So the H-alpha lines transition
from N equals to 3 to N

1187
00:49:18,841 --> 00:49:19,400
equals 2.

1188
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:19,755
MICHAEL SHORT: Mm-hmm.

1189
00:49:19,755 --> 00:49:21,210
AUDIENCE: Would you call that--

1190
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:25,072
in our previous notation, would
you call that LM transition?

1191
00:49:25,072 --> 00:49:26,030
MICHAEL SHORT: Correct.

1192
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:29,010
In our pre-- in
our other notation,

1193
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:31,970
this would be known
as an LM electron.

1194
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:34,700
And probably L1M1
because there is only one

1195
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:37,665
electron in hydrogen. Yep.

1196
00:49:37,665 --> 00:49:39,290
So don't let the
notations trip you up.

1197
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:39,957
As long as you--

1198
00:49:39,957 --> 00:49:42,500
I'm sure someone's
got a chart of L

1199
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,650
equals 2 equals whatever
other Greek letter

1200
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,262
someone has designated it for.

1201
00:49:47,262 --> 00:49:49,470
There's just different ways
of saying the same thing.

1202
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:51,190
So as long as you
know the physics,

1203
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:55,410
looking up the notation is
just kind of a little pain.

1204
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:58,260
Any other questions on
radioactive decay or competing

1205
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:58,950
mechanisms?

1206
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:04,760
Cool.

1207
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,560
Let's take a 10 minute break.

1208
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,890
So I'll see you guys upstairs
in Room 307 in 10 minutes.

1209
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:13,890
There's no projector there, so
we'll do it all on the board.

1210
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:14,390
All right.

1211
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:17,690
So I want to start off the
second half of today's class

1212
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:19,595
by posing and
answering a question.

1213
00:50:19,595 --> 00:50:24,330
Who's still mentally having
trouble grasping this idea?

1214
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:25,560
What did I tell you?

1215
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,108
Yeah.

1216
00:50:26,108 --> 00:50:28,400
So whoever I said it to, I
said at least half the class

1217
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,210
is right there with
you, it's true.

1218
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:31,860
So in a sentence, it's this--

1219
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:35,330
Q is the conversion
of mass to energy.

1220
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:37,287
That's all.

1221
00:50:37,287 --> 00:50:39,370
And the whole point of
doing this nuclear reaction

1222
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:42,460
energetics to find out if
things are or aren't allowed,

1223
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,140
if they're exo or
endothermic is to see

1224
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:46,660
how much mass is
converted to energy

1225
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:51,360
or how much energy has
to be converted to mass.

1226
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,860
And if you have
trouble remembering,

1227
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,420
just go back to
the equation that I

1228
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,230
see on everybody's T-shirts.

1229
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:59,135
And like I said on the
first day of class,

1230
00:50:59,135 --> 00:51:00,510
everyone's got it
on their shirts

1231
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:03,630
and no one quite understands it,
not even the nuclear engineers.

1232
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:06,870
Because it's very difficult
mentally to grasp the idea

1233
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:09,270
that energy and matter are
two sides of the same coin

1234
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:11,680
or two different forms
of the same thing.

1235
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,600
So for a nuclear reaction
where Q is greater than 0

1236
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:21,330
or exothermic, all that means
is that energy is spontaneously

1237
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:24,620
created from the
destruction of mass.

1238
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:25,940
That's all.

1239
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:32,870
And for a Q less than 0
reaction or endothermic,

1240
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:35,570
when you inject energy into
the system, it is absorbed

1241
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:40,970
and mass is created
straight from this equation.

1242
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:42,680
So does this make more
sense to the folks

1243
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,070
that raised their hands,
which is almost everybody?

1244
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,013
Q is nothing but
a quantification

1245
00:51:48,013 --> 00:51:49,430
of the amount of
matter and energy

1246
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:51,610
that turn from one to the other.

1247
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:53,110
And all the balance
stuff we've been

1248
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,405
doing for almost the last month
has been to serve, to quantify,

1249
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:58,890
and to predict it.

1250
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:00,860
So I hope that helps.

1251
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:04,070
I know that MIT students
have this gift for being

1252
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:05,930
able to hide behind
the math, and I

1253
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:08,660
know that's true because
I used to be one myself.

1254
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,070
And you could get
through the day

1255
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:13,970
or get through the class getting
the math right without really

1256
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:16,340
understanding the
physics or the mechanism

1257
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,508
behind what's going on.

1258
00:52:17,508 --> 00:52:19,550
So everything we've done
for the last three weeks

1259
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:21,212
can be summed up
in one sentence--

1260
00:52:21,212 --> 00:52:22,670
mass and energy
are the same thing.

1261
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:28,050
We've just had a lot of math
to get there and be able to--

1262
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:29,633
yeah, it still kind
of makes your head

1263
00:52:29,633 --> 00:52:30,930
want to explode, right?

1264
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:32,640
If you think about
it, if you make an--

1265
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,150
we want to make an
endothermic reaction happen,

1266
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:38,750
you have to put kinetic energy
into one of the particles.

1267
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:43,850
And that system in the
just barely-allowed state,

1268
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:46,170
the nuclei won't really be
moving, or at least the--

1269
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:46,670
yeah.

1270
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:48,545
The nuclei won't really
be moving afterwards,

1271
00:52:48,545 --> 00:52:51,100
because you'll have
turned energy into matter.

1272
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:55,310
That kinetic energy is
turned into mass energy.

1273
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:58,070
Just like you can turn potential
into kinetic or thermal

1274
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:03,570
into mechanical or vice versa,
it's other forms of energy.

1275
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:05,890
Kind of mind-blowing.

1276
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:09,670
Well anyway, so now that we
finished radioactive decay,

1277
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:12,568
I want to get into the
concept of activity half-life,

1278
00:53:12,568 --> 00:53:14,110
and then we're going
to start but not

1279
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:18,760
finish serial radioactive
creation and destruction.

1280
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:22,150
In your readings, you'll see an
equation that looks something

1281
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:25,660
like this where we're going to
be at the end of the day today.

1282
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:30,610
If you want to show off
how much of some isotope N1

1283
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:32,560
exists as a function
of time, you

1284
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,435
may have seen something
that looks like this.

1285
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,860
We're going to be
able to understand

1286
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:44,580
how these equations are created,
and because this is MIT,

1287
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:49,650
we're going to take
it further and add

1288
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:54,060
specifically driven
mechanisms, like can you

1289
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:57,060
create an isotope
not just by decay

1290
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:00,150
from one isotope to another,
but by intentionally making it?

1291
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:04,140
Which is exactly how NAA Nuclear
Activation Analysis works.

1292
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,450
You fire neutrons
into a material.

1293
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:10,117
They turn into something else
and start decaying in series.

1294
00:54:10,117 --> 00:54:12,450
This is what we're going to
be working out the math for,

1295
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:14,850
but I want to make
sure at every step

1296
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:17,100
that we get the physics right.

1297
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:20,220
So first, a very quick
primer on where--

1298
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,150
what is activity and where
does half-life come from?

1299
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:31,020
So we define the A, the
activity of a substance

1300
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:34,650
as pretty simple.

1301
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:38,300
It depends on the amount of
the substance that's there,

1302
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:41,190
and it depends on what's
called this decay constant.

1303
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:45,680
So this amount-- let's
just say like atoms.

1304
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:50,780
And this decay constant is
in units of 1 over second.

1305
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:53,570
An activity is in,
let's say, atoms

1306
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:58,950
destroyed or decays per second.

1307
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:02,720
That thing right there is called
the decay constant, lambda.

1308
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:09,520
And if we want to see, let's
say, how much of a substance

1309
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,670
is decaying at a certain
time or what's its activity

1310
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:16,460
and get a measure of how quickly
does it take to decay away,

1311
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,400
we can start by saying,
well this in effect

1312
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,790
is a destruction
rate of isotope N.

1313
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:25,150
So we can make the simplest
of differential equations

1314
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:30,100
and say, the amount of substance
N as a function of time

1315
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:36,470
is just minus its activity,
which equals minus lambda n.

1316
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:39,260
I hope I don't have to explain
how to solve this differential

1317
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:42,230
equation, so I'm going to go
through it pretty quickly.

1318
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:45,100
What's the method
you use for this

1319
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,870
to get n as a function of t?

1320
00:55:49,582 --> 00:55:50,718
AUDIENCE: 3?

1321
00:55:50,718 --> 00:55:51,510
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

1322
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:54,093
You're all in 18-03 or
have finished 18-03, right?

1323
00:55:54,093 --> 00:55:55,260
This should have been day 1.

1324
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,200
So we'll just separate
variables, divide each side

1325
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,100
by N, multiply side by dt.

1326
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:06,142
So we get dN over N
equals negative lambda dt.

1327
00:56:06,142 --> 00:56:12,810
You can integrate both sides,
and we get the natural log of N

1328
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:17,678
equals minus lambda t plus
some integration constant.

1329
00:56:17,678 --> 00:56:19,470
We're going to do a
little bit of trickery,

1330
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:24,220
and to make things in a nice
form that we can deal with,

1331
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:28,190
let's just call this log of N0.

1332
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:29,450
They're just numbers, right?

1333
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:33,180
We haven't defined what this
constant of integration is.

1334
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:35,930
Everyone cool with
us doing that?

1335
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:40,220
So then we can subtract
log of N0 from each side.

1336
00:56:42,992 --> 00:56:52,910
And we get log N minus log
of N0 equals minus lambda t.

1337
00:56:52,910 --> 00:57:01,370
So this is like saying log of N
over N0 equals minus lambda t.

1338
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:03,260
We'll take either the
power of both sides

1339
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:09,580
and we get N over and not
equals e to the minus lambda t.

1340
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:13,560
And right there you've got your
exponential decay equation.

1341
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:16,600
This is the easy part.

1342
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,720
And what this tells you is it
is a larger decay constant.

1343
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,370
Well let me ask you
a question, then.

1344
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:24,160
Would a larger decay
constant mean a faster

1345
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,358
or a slower decaying isotope?

1346
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:33,250
A larger decay
constant-- correct--

1347
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:36,220
means that you've got more
of these decays happening

1348
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,780
per second.

1349
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:43,050
So a larger lambda
means faster decay.

1350
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,330
And we also can
define a quantity

1351
00:57:49,330 --> 00:58:02,420
called the half-life, which
means N at t 1/2 equals 1/2 N0.

1352
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:07,670
So for that, all you have to
do is plug in t 1/2 for t,

1353
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:12,980
and 1/2 N0 for N0, and you
actually get this relation

1354
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:20,180
where the half-life is just log
of 2 over lambda, better known

1355
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:22,700
as 0.693.

1356
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:25,690
But we'll just leave it
as log of 2 for exactness.

1357
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:28,610
And that's all there really
is for decay in half-life.

1358
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:30,500
So I'll pose another
question to you.

1359
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:35,420
Something with a
larger decay constant,

1360
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:38,680
will it have a larger
or a smaller half-life?

1361
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:39,540
AUDIENCE: Smaller?

1362
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:42,210
MICHAEL SHORT: Smaller, because
they're inversely related.

1363
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:49,440
So I'd say from this
quick derivation,

1364
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,990
these are the two
things to note.

1365
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:54,870
Is that something with a larger
decay constant decays faster

1366
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:57,210
and therefore has a
shorter half-life.

1367
00:58:57,210 --> 00:59:00,000
So when we were separating
out our isotopes in nuclear

1368
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,700
activation analysis into
what Mike called the shorts

1369
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:06,840
and the longs, he was separating
them by half-life to say that--

1370
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,670
let's say the same
amount of activation

1371
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:11,100
or the same amount
of creation, the ones

1372
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:15,420
with shorter half-lives will
be hotter, more radioactive,

1373
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:17,052
but for less time.

1374
00:59:17,052 --> 00:59:18,510
And so what we're
going to be doing

1375
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:21,150
is what's called short
nuclear activation analysis

1376
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:23,610
because we don't want to
count for like days or weeks

1377
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:24,120
or months.

1378
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:24,760
Yep?

1379
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,010
AUDIENCE: So is half-life--
is the decay constant just

1380
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:29,915
a property of the given
substance, given element?

1381
00:59:29,915 --> 00:59:31,290
MICHAEL SHORT:
The decay constant

1382
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:33,090
is a property of
the given isotope

1383
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:35,650
specific to that type of decay.

1384
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:40,740
So if we were to draw that
generalized radioactivity

1385
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:41,310
diagram--

1386
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:46,530
let's say we have potassium-40,
which can either go by beta

1387
00:59:46,530 --> 00:59:48,990
decay to--

1388
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:51,060
what comes in beta--
what comes after--

1389
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:53,490
I think it's calcium-40.

1390
00:59:53,490 --> 01:00:02,560
Or it can go by positron or
electron capture to argon-40.

1391
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:05,433
Each of these processes
has a different half-life.

1392
01:00:05,433 --> 01:00:06,850
And then in that
chain-- remember,

1393
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:10,210
let's do the
americium-241, and I'm

1394
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:12,190
going to channel
my one-year-old son

1395
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:14,995
in drawing this decay diagram.

1396
01:00:14,995 --> 01:00:21,720
It looks something like that
with all sorts of transitions.

1397
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,010
I didn't scream like he
usually does, but whatever.

1398
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:25,562
We're on camera.

1399
01:00:25,562 --> 01:00:27,520
Each of these decay--
each of these transitions

1400
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,140
may also have its own half-life.

1401
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:31,210
So between isometric
transitions,

1402
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:34,175
they're usually very, very
fast, but once in a while

1403
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:34,675
they're not.

1404
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:42,950
Like technetium-99
metastable to technetium-99

1405
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:46,340
has a half-life of
around six days,

1406
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:50,730
which is why it's so useful
as a medical isotope.

1407
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,210
So when you see something
marked M for metastable,

1408
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:57,560
all that means is there
is some sort of a gamma,

1409
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,560
also known as an IT
transition, with a particularly

1410
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:01,832
long half-life.

1411
01:01:04,487 --> 01:01:06,070
Everyone clear on
what all that means?

1412
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:10,773
Cool.

1413
01:01:10,773 --> 01:01:12,190
Well, there'll be
some time for it

1414
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:17,560
to sink in because with
these definitions in hand,

1415
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,690
I want to pose a
problem to you guys.

1416
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:31,200
Let's say I start off with
some amount of an isotope N1.

1417
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,780
And it decays by
some mechanism--

1418
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:35,350
we don't care what--

1419
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:40,350
to isotope N2, and it
decays to some isotope N3

1420
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:45,480
with decay constants
lambda 1 and lambda 2.

1421
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:49,140
This is what we call
serial radioactive decay.

1422
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:58,010
How do we construct
a system of equations

1423
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:03,080
to tell us what is N1 as
a function of time, what

1424
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:06,710
is N2 as a function
of time, and what

1425
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:11,210
is N3 as a function of time?

1426
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:13,568
Where do we begin
in a general sense?

1427
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:19,980
OK, so let's start with N1.

1428
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,990
We kind of have an
expression for N1 already,

1429
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:24,840
but let's start out with
a differential equation.

1430
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,760
So the form of all
of these equations

1431
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:30,090
for everything serial
radioactive decay and burning

1432
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:33,300
isotopes in a reactor and
creating isotopes in a reactor

1433
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:36,060
is going to take
the following form.

1434
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:39,370
The general equation is simple.

1435
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:46,265
The change equals creation
minus destruction.

1436
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:54,070
Or the simple thing is
let's say the change is

1437
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:57,280
a source minus a sink.

1438
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,920
And we'll have to come up for
every one of these isotopes

1439
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,830
for a mathematical way to
describe what's the source

1440
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:04,330
and what's the sink.

1441
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:08,170
So if we want to
measure the change in N1

1442
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:12,410
as a function of time, what
are the sources of isotope N1?

1443
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:13,825
Yeah?

1444
01:03:13,825 --> 01:03:15,200
AUDIENCE: Isn't
there no sources?

1445
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,690
MICHAEL SHORT: No sources.

1446
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:21,140
We're starting off with
some fixed quantity of N1.

1447
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:24,260
Let's just call it N1,0.

1448
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:27,320
But you're right, there's
no continuous source

1449
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,480
of isotope N1.

1450
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:33,296
What about its destruction?

1451
01:03:33,296 --> 01:03:35,197
AUDIENCE: Decay to N2?

1452
01:03:35,197 --> 01:03:36,030
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

1453
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:36,840
Decay to N2.

1454
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:40,540
So we've got the equation
for that right there.

1455
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:44,410
it depends on the decay
constant of number 1

1456
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:46,347
and the amount of number 1.

1457
01:03:46,347 --> 01:03:47,430
So what we're doing here--

1458
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:50,470
I love how this course is
timed with 18-03 because you're

1459
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:53,280
learning ordinary differential
equations in 18-03,

1460
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,780
and we're going to be solving
everyday ordinary differential

1461
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:57,722
equations for a fair
bit of this course.

1462
01:03:57,722 --> 01:03:59,180
So it's one of
those rare times you

1463
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:01,780
get to like learn math and
put it to use at the same time

1464
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:04,930
instead of six years later,
it's just kind of nice.

1465
01:04:04,930 --> 01:04:06,590
So that's easy.

1466
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:08,430
Let's go to the more
challenging one.

1467
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:13,280
What is the source
of isotope N2?

1468
01:04:16,082 --> 01:04:17,272
AUDIENCE: Decay from N1?

1469
01:04:17,272 --> 01:04:18,480
MICHAEL SHORT: Decay from N1.

1470
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,744
So how would I
mathematically write that?

1471
01:04:21,744 --> 01:04:23,910
AUDIENCE: Just lambda 1 N1.

1472
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:27,780
MICHAEL SHORT: Just lambda 1 N1.

1473
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:33,780
And what is the
destruction of isotope N2?

1474
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:35,679
Anyone else?

1475
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:36,932
AUDIENCE: Lambda 2 N2?

1476
01:04:36,932 --> 01:04:38,390
MICHAEL SHORT:
Takes the same form.

1477
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:40,640
It depends on the decay
concept of isotope 2

1478
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,280
and the amount of
isotope 2 that's there.

1479
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:48,920
How about isotope 3?

1480
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,848
Where does that come from?

1481
01:04:55,186 --> 01:04:56,308
AUDIENCE: Lambda 2 N2?

1482
01:04:56,308 --> 01:04:57,350
MICHAEL SHORT: That's it.

1483
01:04:57,350 --> 01:05:01,310
The source is lambda 2 N2.

1484
01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:03,276
What are the sinks
or the destruction?

1485
01:05:03,276 --> 01:05:04,150
AUDIENCE: Nothing.

1486
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:05,860
MICHAEL SHORT: Nothing.

1487
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:10,210
So we have a very simple set
of posed differential equations

1488
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:13,540
to describe the production and
the destruction of these three

1489
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:14,830
isotopes.

1490
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:18,670
So let's imagine now
that N1 was, let's say,

1491
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:22,490
radium, which exists all
throughout the soil and rocks;

1492
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:27,040
N2 is radon, the gas that's
produced from radium decay;

1493
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:30,640
and then N3 could be let's
say one of the stable daughter

1494
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:31,877
products of radon.

1495
01:05:31,877 --> 01:05:33,460
So these are the
sorts of calculations

1496
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:35,688
that are done all the
time in real life to see--

1497
01:05:35,688 --> 01:05:37,480
if you know how much
radium is in the rock,

1498
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,850
how much radon do you
expect to breathe in?

1499
01:05:39,850 --> 01:05:42,850
Because at the same time
you're producing radon

1500
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:44,740
from radium decay.

1501
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:47,410
And the radon is
decaying itself.

1502
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,750
So you can't just say, oh,
the activity of the radium

1503
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:51,700
equals the amount of
radon because it's

1504
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:54,490
being created and destroyed
all at the same time,

1505
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:56,940
and it depends on how
much there is around.

1506
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:59,650
Same thing with nuclear
activation analysis.

1507
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:05,470
You'll, let's say, you'd
start off with sodium-21,

1508
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:08,440
you can create sodium-22.

1509
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:12,060
Sodium-22 will decay
by positron emission.

1510
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:14,460
What comes before sodium?

1511
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:21,200
Probably neon, I think, 22.

1512
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,880
That's my guess.

1513
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:23,510
Yeah.

1514
01:06:23,510 --> 01:06:26,750
So if you want to say how
much sodium-22 is there,

1515
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:29,690
well you're both creating it
from sodium-21 from neutron

1516
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:33,290
absorption, and you're
decaying it naturally

1517
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:36,178
by positron emission
among other processes.

1518
01:06:36,178 --> 01:06:38,720
We're going to get back into
how do we deal with the neutrons

1519
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:42,230
thing probably on
Tuesday, But for now,

1520
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:45,660
let's work on solving
this system of equations.

1521
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:48,020
So I think N1 is pretty
easy because we already

1522
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:49,713
have the solution for it.

1523
01:06:49,713 --> 01:06:50,630
So I'll just write it.

1524
01:06:54,058 --> 01:06:54,558
1t.

1525
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:01,060
The harder one is N2.

1526
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:03,940
So what can we start by doing?

1527
01:07:06,450 --> 01:07:10,330
We've got an ordinary
differential equation with--

1528
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:13,480
it's just this first order,
but there's two variables.

1529
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:14,230
So how do we deal?

1530
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:21,760
AUDIENCE: Pick another equation?

1531
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,302
MICHAEL SHORT: We do it-- well,
we have other equations, so--

1532
01:07:24,302 --> 01:07:25,510
actually, we've got this one.

1533
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:26,050
Yes.

1534
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:30,460
Substitute N1 in here so we
get everything in terms of N2

1535
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:33,280
and constants and type.

1536
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:41,650
So we'll rewrite this equation
as dN2/dt, which I'm also just

1537
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:43,603
going to write as N2 prime.

1538
01:07:43,603 --> 01:07:45,520
And when you use this a
little bit of notation

1539
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,260
that I'll leave up
there on the board

1540
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:49,870
because it's going to be
a lot faster in writing.

1541
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:54,760
Which equals lambda 1 and
10e to the minus lambda

1542
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:58,260
1t minus lambda 2 N2.

1543
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,440
Can we separate variables here?

1544
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:10,080
I don't see an easy way.

1545
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:15,690
So, 18-03 experts, how do we
solve this type of first order

1546
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:18,540
differential equation?

1547
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:19,486
And I'll give you--

1548
01:08:19,486 --> 01:08:21,069
l won't give you a
hint, I'll give you

1549
01:08:21,069 --> 01:08:22,990
a little bit of consolation.

1550
01:08:22,990 --> 01:08:26,260
No one from last year
knew how to approach this.

1551
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:28,890
So if you don't know, I
won't be disappointed.

1552
01:08:28,890 --> 01:08:30,350
Yeah?

1553
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:33,432
AUDIENCE: You've got
N2 dot plus lambda 2

1554
01:08:33,432 --> 01:08:37,280
N2 equals lambda 1 N1 dot--

1555
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,689
MICHAEL SHORT: Mm-hmm.

1556
01:08:39,689 --> 01:08:41,020
AUDIENCE: So you could put--

1557
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:44,200
add lambda 2 N2 to both sides.

1558
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,720
MICHAEL SHORT: Add lambda
2 N2 to the both sides.

1559
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,670
I think you're on to
what I'm thinking about.

1560
01:08:56,810 --> 01:08:59,270
Also, if you can't
read something I write,

1561
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:01,830
please stop me and let me know
and I'll be happy to erase it.

1562
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:03,380
I don't think I've
said that yet,

1563
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,090
but it takes a lot
of control for me

1564
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:07,279
to get my handwriting legible
on the board let alone

1565
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:08,112
on a piece of paper.

1566
01:09:08,112 --> 01:09:11,189
So if you can't read,
please let me know.

1567
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:11,779
OK.

1568
01:09:11,779 --> 01:09:15,800
So now we've got the N2's
separate from the N1's, what

1569
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,460
do we do next?

1570
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:18,750
AUDIENCE: --N2 has
the form A times

1571
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:21,500
e to the negative lambda 1t?

1572
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,770
MICHAEL SHORT: OK,
let's try this.

1573
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:28,127
Assume N2 has the
form e to the what?

1574
01:09:28,127 --> 01:09:30,877
AUDIENCE: Negative lambda 1t?

1575
01:09:30,877 --> 01:09:32,544
MICHAEL SHORT:
Negative-- has the form e

1576
01:09:32,544 --> 01:09:34,090
to the lambda negative 1t.

1577
01:09:34,090 --> 01:09:35,560
AUDIENCE: With that A in front--

1578
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:37,960
MICHAEL SHORT: With an A,
some constant in front.

1579
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:41,090
What makes you say that?

1580
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:43,340
AUDIENCE: Like if you take
the derivative with respect

1581
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:45,597
to time, then the next
term will still have a e

1582
01:09:45,597 --> 01:09:47,065
to the negative lambda 1t?

1583
01:09:47,065 --> 01:09:47,982
MICHAEL SHORT: Mm-hmm.

1584
01:09:47,982 --> 01:09:50,477
AUDIENCE: Cancel all
those out and solve for A.

1585
01:09:50,477 --> 01:09:51,310
MICHAEL SHORT: Cool.

1586
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:53,450
So that is one way to do it.

1587
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:55,490
It's going to get a
little messy, though.

1588
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:57,130
There's another
method specifically

1589
01:09:57,130 --> 01:09:59,510
for equations of the form.

1590
01:09:59,510 --> 01:10:01,990
Let's call it y prime plus--

1591
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:04,340
I'm going to use notation
they may have used in 18-03.

1592
01:10:07,651 --> 01:10:09,105
I hear a couple of aha.

1593
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:15,380
Anything look familiar
about this type of equation?

1594
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:17,690
OK, what is it?

1595
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:18,690
AUDIENCE: Not following.

1596
01:10:18,690 --> 01:10:21,160
[LAUGHTER]

1597
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:23,230
MICHAEL SHORT:
It's not that hard.

1598
01:10:23,230 --> 01:10:25,570
Anyone remember the
word integrating factor?

1599
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:34,960
And it was probably done
horribly and on like six math

1600
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:35,860
boards or whatever.

1601
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:39,940
So I'm going to show you
the simpler way to do this.

1602
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:43,180
The idea here is we want
to multiply everything

1603
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:49,030
by something-- by
some function mu.

1604
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:52,260
Put a mu there, put a mu
there, put a mu there.

1605
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:54,010
I think that's the
notation that's usually

1606
01:10:54,010 --> 01:10:56,950
used in differential
equations, such

1607
01:10:56,950 --> 01:11:01,910
that this thing right here is
shrinkable through the product

1608
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:02,410
rule.

1609
01:11:05,290 --> 01:11:06,960
Or the product rule--

1610
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:10,360
I'm not assuming
everyone remembers--

1611
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:16,315
says that let's say you
have some function a of t,

1612
01:11:16,315 --> 01:11:27,220
b of t prime is like a prime
times b plus a times b prime.

1613
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:29,110
So we're kind of getting
around to the method

1614
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:30,693
that Luke was talking
about, but we're

1615
01:11:30,693 --> 01:11:33,100
going to do it by a little
bit of a cleaner way.

1616
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:36,880
We multiply every term
by some function mu

1617
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,510
such that this part is one
of these perfect product

1618
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:43,090
rules at which point we
can shrink and integrate

1619
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:44,530
the expression.

1620
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:46,840
Without going through
the derivation of how

1621
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,850
integrating factors
are done, I'll

1622
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:52,390
just let you know that
this function mu ends up

1623
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:56,300
being e to the integral of p.

1624
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:01,595
Hat is our integrating factor.

1625
01:12:01,595 --> 01:12:03,470
So that's the end result
of what was probably

1626
01:12:03,470 --> 01:12:05,360
six boards of 18-03.

1627
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,310
Am I right or am I mistaken?

1628
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:09,230
Well, things haven't
changed in 15 years.

1629
01:12:09,230 --> 01:12:10,130
Cool.

1630
01:12:10,130 --> 01:12:16,140
OK, so what is mu
for this equation?

1631
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:21,220
Luckily, p of t
is pretty simple.

1632
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:22,870
Which part of this
equation right here

1633
01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:26,624
is our p of t-like term?

1634
01:12:26,624 --> 01:12:28,810
AUDIENCE: Lambda 2 N2.

1635
01:12:28,810 --> 01:12:31,810
MICHAEL SHORT:
Actually, just lambda 2.

1636
01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:34,180
Because we've got our
variable right here

1637
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:37,960
that right there is our p of t.

1638
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:43,780
So we'll just say that mu
equals e to the integral of--

1639
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:51,700
uh, yep-- of lambda 2 dt, which
is just e to the lambda 2t.

1640
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,160
That's our integrating
factor right there.

1641
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:59,560
So we'll multiply every
term right here by that.

1642
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:07,090
So we'll say e to the lambda 2t
times and N2 prime plus lambda

1643
01:13:07,090 --> 01:13:09,610
2 e to the lambda 2t.

1644
01:13:09,610 --> 01:13:13,030
Anyone see what
is going on here?

1645
01:13:13,030 --> 01:13:15,190
There's the product
rule thing going on--

1646
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:24,100
times N2 plus e to the
lambda 2t times lambda 1 N10

1647
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:28,210
e to the minus
lambda 1t equals 0.

1648
01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:32,350
And we have successfully
created something here

1649
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:34,130
that can be shrunk up
with a product rule.

1650
01:13:34,130 --> 01:13:34,310
Yeah?

1651
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:35,774
AUDIENCE: Should
that be a minus e

1652
01:13:35,774 --> 01:13:39,190
to the lambda 2t lambda 1 N1--

1653
01:13:39,190 --> 01:13:41,142
when you moved it over?

1654
01:13:41,142 --> 01:13:42,322
It's positive--

1655
01:13:42,322 --> 01:13:43,280
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh yeah.

1656
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,640
There's an equal sign
there, isn't there?

1657
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:45,920
That's what tripped me up.

1658
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,030
Thank you.

1659
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:50,300
So there is indeed
a minus sign there

1660
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:53,030
because I skipped the
step putting everything

1661
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:54,670
on one side of the equation.

1662
01:13:54,670 --> 01:13:55,170
Yep?

1663
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:58,905
AUDIENCE: Could we do this with
variational parameters instead?

1664
01:13:58,905 --> 01:14:01,530
MICHAEL SHORT: Where you replace
one variable with-- or replace

1665
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:03,256
a couple of variables
with another one?

1666
01:14:03,256 --> 01:14:06,588
AUDIENCE: Well yeah, just
like the homogeneous solution,

1667
01:14:06,588 --> 01:14:09,450
and then you'll
find like a factor--

1668
01:14:09,450 --> 01:14:10,590
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

1669
01:14:10,590 --> 01:14:12,850
There are lots of ways
of solving a first order

1670
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:13,990
ODE like this.

1671
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:14,490
Sure.

1672
01:14:14,490 --> 01:14:16,580
So this would work with
various parameters.

1673
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:18,502
It would work with what
Luke's talking about.

1674
01:14:18,502 --> 01:14:19,460
It works with this one.

1675
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:21,810
This just happened to be
a particularly simple one

1676
01:14:21,810 --> 01:14:24,990
because the integrating
factor's so simple.

1677
01:14:24,990 --> 01:14:27,720
So let's cram this
up right here.

1678
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:32,340
So this is like
saying N2 times e

1679
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:38,310
to the lambda 2t prime minus--

1680
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:41,580
and we've got two
e to the somethings

1681
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:43,990
that we can combine right here.

1682
01:14:43,990 --> 01:14:50,580
So I'll just say lambda
1 and 10e to the lambda

1683
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:57,450
2 minus lambda 1t equals 0.

1684
01:14:57,450 --> 01:15:00,480
So now I will put this
term back on the other side

1685
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:03,820
by doing that.

1686
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:05,380
And now we just
integrate both sides.

1687
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:16,970
And we get N2 e to the
lambda 2t equals, let's see.

1688
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:21,260
Becomes lambda 1
N10 over lambda 2

1689
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:26,330
minus lambda 1 e to
the lambda 2 minus

1690
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:33,280
lambda 1t plus some
integration constant C.

1691
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,920
And in this case, our
initial condition, well,

1692
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:39,130
how much of isotope
N2 did we start with?

1693
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:41,928
Have we specified that yet?

1694
01:15:41,928 --> 01:15:43,740
No?

1695
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:46,990
Let's make it simple.

1696
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:51,450
Let's assume that the initial
amount of isotope N2 equals 0.

1697
01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:53,340
We put some isotope
in the reactor

1698
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:56,342
or start it off with some
amount of isotope like radium.

1699
01:15:56,342 --> 01:15:57,300
Didn't start off with--

1700
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:00,600
it didn't start off with any
radon, and just kept going.

1701
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:04,680
So then all we have to do is
divide each side by either

1702
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:12,680
the lambda 2t, and
that cancels those,

1703
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:20,320
that cancels that and that, and
we end up with N2 as a function

1704
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:28,180
of time equals lambda 1 N1,0
over lambda 2 minus lambda 1

1705
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:34,010
times e to the minus lambda 1t.

1706
01:16:34,010 --> 01:16:34,510
OK.

1707
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:40,850
And we've got an
expression for N2.

1708
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:41,810
How about N3?

1709
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:44,435
Do we even have
to solve this one?

1710
01:16:44,435 --> 01:16:48,342
I see a couple of people shaking
their heads no, why is that?

1711
01:16:48,342 --> 01:16:50,318
AUDIENCE: Basically you
already solved for N1,

1712
01:16:50,318 --> 01:16:52,058
they're just not minus signs.

1713
01:16:52,058 --> 01:16:53,350
MICHAEL SHORT: Well, not quite.

1714
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:56,230
Because we-- well yeah, I guess
we've kind of solved it for N1,

1715
01:16:56,230 --> 01:17:00,760
but now we take this expression
for N2, stick it in here,

1716
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:04,640
and then solve that,
it's going to get messy.

1717
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,880
So I'm going to show you
something mathematically

1718
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,920
now that I'll show
you graphically later.

1719
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:11,481
There's a conservation equation
that we're missing here.

1720
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:24,270
If we sum up isotopes
N1, N2, N3, equals what?

1721
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:25,800
Conserving total
number of atoms.

1722
01:17:28,572 --> 01:17:29,960
AUDIENCE: N1,0?

1723
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:31,250
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

1724
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:32,517
N1,0.

1725
01:17:32,517 --> 01:17:34,100
In this situation
where we started off

1726
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:37,280
with some known quantity
of isotope 1 only,

1727
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:40,160
you can't change the
number of atoms here,

1728
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,290
you can only change
the type of atoms.

1729
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:44,630
So we don't have
to solve for E3--

1730
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:52,240
oh sorry, for N3, because N3
is just N1,0 minus N1 minus N2.

1731
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:56,680
And that takes like an extra 10
minutes out of today's lecture.

1732
01:17:56,680 --> 01:18:00,100
So later on when we have
a projector on Tuesday,

1733
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:02,960
I will show you these
equations graphed out where

1734
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,710
I've-- actually, I'll
share this with you.

1735
01:18:04,710 --> 01:18:08,630
Did I tell you guys about the
Desmos graphical calculator?

1736
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:10,108
Or have I shown this to you yet?

1737
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:17,500
Go here for all of
your graphing needs.

1738
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:21,980
It's free, and the
best part that I like

1739
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:23,930
is that anytime you
define some parameter,

1740
01:18:23,930 --> 01:18:25,970
it automatically
makes a slider bar

1741
01:18:25,970 --> 01:18:28,160
so you can play
with the equations.

1742
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,300
And you can just--

1743
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:31,610
say, like, well
what if L1 and L--

1744
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:32,900
lambda 1 and L2 are equal?

1745
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,233
What if they were way different?

1746
01:18:34,233 --> 01:18:36,798
And it just graphs
the solutions for you.

1747
01:18:36,798 --> 01:18:37,590
It's pretty useful.

1748
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:40,040
So I'll show you some
of that on Tuesday

1749
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:42,040
when we actually have a screen.

1750
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:44,060
Let me see what time it is.

1751
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:46,295
Oh sweet, we've
got plenty of time.

1752
01:18:46,295 --> 01:18:48,170
So now I want to pose
the following questions

1753
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:49,505
to you guys.

1754
01:18:49,505 --> 01:18:51,630
I'm going to erase stuff
from here because we still

1755
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:52,297
have some space.

1756
01:18:58,570 --> 01:19:01,810
How do we model nuclear
activation analysis

1757
01:19:01,810 --> 01:19:05,290
using this kind of equation?

1758
01:19:05,290 --> 01:19:09,370
We'll start off with
the same equation.

1759
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:16,590
So let's say we'll have a minus
lambda 1 N1, we'll have N2,

1760
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:21,570
minus lambda 2 N2
minus something.

1761
01:19:21,570 --> 01:19:27,180
N3 equals something-- let's
see, there's a lambda 1 N1,

1762
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:31,080
there's a lambda 2
N2 minus something.

1763
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:32,880
I've left some
trailing minus signs

1764
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,940
to indicate that we don't have
complete equations for this

1765
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:36,930
yet.

1766
01:19:36,930 --> 01:19:41,640
So for the case of nuclear
activation analysis where

1767
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:43,440
we have some imposed flux--

1768
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:49,215
flux-- of neutrons.

1769
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:56,430
So anyone remember from some
of our previous flash-forwards

1770
01:19:56,430 --> 01:19:59,370
how do we turn these into
creation and destruction rates

1771
01:19:59,370 --> 01:20:00,945
of these different isotopes?

1772
01:20:05,797 --> 01:20:07,130
AUDIENCE: Could you repeat that?

1773
01:20:07,130 --> 01:20:07,922
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

1774
01:20:07,922 --> 01:20:12,200
So let's say we've now
stuck N1 in the reactor.

1775
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:15,140
And we're now using the reactor
to create different isotopes

1776
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:19,220
like N2 and N3, but at the same
time they're in the reactor,

1777
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:21,290
they're getting
cooked as well by some

1778
01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:24,500
imposed flux of neutrons.

1779
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:27,955
How do we set up and not
solve the system of equations

1780
01:20:27,955 --> 01:20:31,750
to describe this?

1781
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:38,012
AUDIENCE: Are they-- are N2
and N3 both getting like--

1782
01:20:38,012 --> 01:20:40,220
MICHAEL SHORT: They're
getting destroyed and whatnot?

1783
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:42,348
AUDIENCE: Are they
just like decaying

1784
01:20:42,348 --> 01:20:45,425
or are they also getting like
added stuff from neutrons--

1785
01:20:45,425 --> 01:20:46,300
MICHAEL SHORT: Well--

1786
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:48,000
AUDIENCE: Because that
depends on the isotope.

1787
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,230
MICHAEL SHORT: That
depends on the isotope.

1788
01:20:49,230 --> 01:20:50,740
So let's define
what the system--

1789
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:52,290
this system is.

1790
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:56,890
Let's say we stuck in
some other isotope N0,

1791
01:20:56,890 --> 01:21:01,680
and we put it in, and we're
going to have to say it's--

1792
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:08,250
if we have N0 prime, some
minus some creation term.

1793
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:13,620
And in this case, N0 can
absorb a neutron to become N1.

1794
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:21,900
N1 is decaying to N2,
N2 is decaying to N3.

1795
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:24,840
But also, N1 can be
burned by neutrons

1796
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:31,750
N2 can be burned by neutrons and
N3 can be burned by neutrons.

1797
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:34,500
So here I've given you kind
of a simplistic situation that

1798
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:35,940
doesn't usually exist.

1799
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:38,070
Here I've given you
a situation that you

1800
01:21:38,070 --> 01:21:40,200
could replicate in the reactor.

1801
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:44,310
How do we model this nuclear
activation analysis process?

1802
01:21:49,957 --> 01:21:51,540
Well first of all,
what's the creation

1803
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:57,647
rate of N0, the stuff
we put in the reactor?

1804
01:21:57,647 --> 01:21:58,480
Are we creating any?

1805
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:05,140
No?

1806
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:05,640
Luke?

1807
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:09,528
AUDIENCE: It's all going
to be created if N2 absorbs

1808
01:22:09,528 --> 01:22:11,515
the neutron and [INAUDIBLE]?

1809
01:22:11,515 --> 01:22:12,640
MICHAEL SHORT: It could be.

1810
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:16,700
So if we had this for the
following nuclear reaction,

1811
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:18,560
now it's getting crazy.

1812
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:21,060
We can model that, too.

1813
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:21,670
Let's do it.

1814
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:23,462
OK, I was going to say
no, but let's do it.

1815
01:22:26,990 --> 01:22:29,210
We can-- so what I'm
trying to do here is

1816
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:31,190
give you the mathematical
tools to model

1817
01:22:31,190 --> 01:22:33,290
any real physical situation.

1818
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:35,540
Usually in this class
like when I took it,

1819
01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:37,010
the discussion
stopped here and we

1820
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:39,950
got to start looking at
different graphs of secular

1821
01:22:39,950 --> 01:22:42,920
versus transient equilibrium
like in the reading.

1822
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,990
But I want you guys to
have the intuition to say,

1823
01:22:44,990 --> 01:22:47,960
all right, let's take any
crazy decay diagram, right?

1824
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:52,340
And N3 becomes N1,
let's just go nuts.

1825
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:54,140
How do we set up the
differential equations

1826
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:58,860
for this assuming that
computers can solve them?

1827
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:02,490
In every case-- where's
my long pointer?

1828
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:04,440
Go back to this here.

1829
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:07,440
The change is the creation
minus the destruction.

1830
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,240
So what are all the
creation sources

1831
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:10,778
in our new scenario for N0?

1832
01:23:18,110 --> 01:23:20,010
Well I pose you a
simpler question.

1833
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:23,340
If there is no isotope
N2, can you create any N0?

1834
01:23:25,950 --> 01:23:26,940
No.

1835
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:30,540
Because the only way to
make N0 is to start with N2.

1836
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:36,720
So we know its creation term
is going to have an N2 in it.

1837
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,312
What else does it depend on?

1838
01:23:39,312 --> 01:23:40,858
AUDIENCE: Cross-section.

1839
01:23:40,858 --> 01:23:43,150
MICHAEL SHORT: I heard both
of the pieces of the answer

1840
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:44,840
correct at the same time.

1841
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:47,650
It depends on the
flux of neutrons,

1842
01:23:47,650 --> 01:23:50,680
and it depends on
the cross-section.

1843
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,860
This macroscopic
cross-section right here.

1844
01:23:55,716 --> 01:23:57,144
OK?

1845
01:23:57,144 --> 01:23:58,088
Or I'm sorry, no, no.

1846
01:23:58,088 --> 01:23:59,880
It depends on the
microscopic cross-section

1847
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:02,890
because we have an amount of N2.

1848
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:07,190
But it does depend on how
many neutrons you throw at it

1849
01:24:07,190 --> 01:24:10,770
and what is the probability
of each of those neutrons

1850
01:24:10,770 --> 01:24:12,910
make some N0.

1851
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:16,390
So what we've got right
here is a reaction rate.

1852
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:23,050
So who remembers from the
like second or third lecture,

1853
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:25,270
we said a reaction
rate can be expressed

1854
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:29,350
like macroscopic
cross-section times of flux,

1855
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:32,080
which is the same as a
microscopic cross-section times

1856
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:35,960
number density times flux?

1857
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:38,782
But this is better known as
a macroscopic cross-section.

1858
01:24:41,497 --> 01:24:43,830
Remember, I kind of showed
this to you very briefly when

1859
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:45,205
we talk about
cross-sections, now

1860
01:24:45,205 --> 01:24:47,108
is where we actually use them.

1861
01:24:47,108 --> 01:24:48,900
So the cross-section's
like the probability

1862
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:54,090
that a neutron coming in to atom
N is going to react with it.

1863
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:58,500
The macroscopic cross-section
in units of, let's say,

1864
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:02,342
1 over centimeters
is the total--

1865
01:25:02,342 --> 01:25:04,800
let's say the total probability
accounting for how many are

1866
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:10,560
there, and the flux is in
neutrons per centimeter

1867
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,630
squared per second.

1868
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:16,650
Combine these together,
and you get a reaction rate

1869
01:25:16,650 --> 01:25:22,890
in atoms per centimeter
cubed per second,

1870
01:25:22,890 --> 01:25:25,545
a volumetric reaction rate.

1871
01:25:25,545 --> 01:25:26,210
There we go.

1872
01:25:28,810 --> 01:25:31,960
So N1 can be created.

1873
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:36,430
Let's give this cross-section
a designation from N2 to N0.

1874
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:41,240
So let's call it
cross-section 2,0.

1875
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:43,680
How can N not be destroyed?

1876
01:25:48,452 --> 01:25:52,390
I'll give you a hint, it looks
very similar to this term.

1877
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:53,952
Anyone want to take a guess?

1878
01:25:58,762 --> 01:25:59,724
Yeah?

1879
01:25:59,724 --> 01:26:01,952
AUDIENCE: Could it
undergo fission?

1880
01:26:01,952 --> 01:26:03,660
MICHAEL SHORT: We
haven't specified that.

1881
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:06,560
I'm going to cut the
craziness at there, I think.

1882
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,310
But just look at the
reactions right here.

1883
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:11,280
N0 can absorb a
neutron and become N1.

1884
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,144
So how do we
mathematically write that?

1885
01:26:16,126 --> 01:26:18,818
AUDIENCE: Minus the
cross-section N--

1886
01:26:18,818 --> 01:26:19,610
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

1887
01:26:19,610 --> 01:26:20,870
Minus the cross-section of?

1888
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:21,950
AUDIENCE: N1.

1889
01:26:21,950 --> 01:26:23,960
MICHAEL SHORT: Let's
say 0 going to 1.

1890
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,340
Let's just call it that.

1891
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:27,550
Times the neutron flux.

1892
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:28,520
Times what?

1893
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:30,290
AUDIENCE: Times N0?

1894
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:33,170
MICHAEL SHORT: Times the
amount that's there, N0.

1895
01:26:33,170 --> 01:26:34,610
So this is your
destruction term.

1896
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:41,440
Using this pattern, we can
fill in all the remaining terms

1897
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,570
for all the remaining isotopes.

1898
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:48,166
So what are the creation
mechanisms for isotope N1?

1899
01:26:53,402 --> 01:26:54,610
Well, just follow the arrows.

1900
01:26:54,610 --> 01:26:55,568
AUDIENCE: --same term--

1901
01:26:55,568 --> 01:26:56,485
MICHAEL SHORT: Mm-hmm.

1902
01:26:56,485 --> 01:26:58,320
AUDIENCE: --on the
first equation for N--

1903
01:26:58,320 --> 01:26:59,200
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

1904
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:00,130
There's this one right here.

1905
01:27:00,130 --> 01:27:00,590
We can have--

1906
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:01,270
AUDIENCE: --the sign.

1907
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:03,640
MICHAEL SHORT: But flip the
sign because it's creation.

1908
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:08,500
So sigma 0,1 flux N0.

1909
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:11,080
And what else can create
N1 because we're just

1910
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:12,520
going crazy today?

1911
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:16,460
N3 can create N1
because we said so.

1912
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:19,360
But-- yeah, because we said so.

1913
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:23,260
So now we'll say also we'll
have this cross-section for 3

1914
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:28,050
turning into 1
times flux times N3.

1915
01:27:28,050 --> 01:27:33,150
Minus the decay of N1 using
our activity expression, minus

1916
01:27:33,150 --> 01:27:34,116
what else?

1917
01:27:37,005 --> 01:27:38,463
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
cross-section

1918
01:27:38,463 --> 01:27:40,463
of the [INAUDIBLE]?

1919
01:27:40,463 --> 01:27:41,880
MICHAEL SHORT: I
heard some-- yep,

1920
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:44,948
that will be the
cross-section of N1.

1921
01:27:44,948 --> 01:27:46,990
Let's call it going to
some isotope we don't care

1922
01:27:46,990 --> 01:27:52,360
about times the flux times N1.

1923
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:55,770
So as long as you can
draw a like arrow decay

1924
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:58,380
and destruction
production diagram,

1925
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:00,382
we can put this to math.

1926
01:28:00,382 --> 01:28:01,340
That's the crazy thing.

1927
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:02,132
Let's finish it up.

1928
01:28:02,132 --> 01:28:03,500
How about N2?

1929
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:06,080
We know that N1 can decay to N2.

1930
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:09,960
What are the other
production mechanisms for N2?

1931
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:12,826
Follow the arrows.

1932
01:28:12,826 --> 01:28:14,280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1933
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:15,920
MICHAEL SHORT: That's it.

1934
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:18,170
Because we're not changing
anything at this point.

1935
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:22,904
What are all the destruction
mechanisms for N2?

1936
01:28:22,904 --> 01:28:24,880
AUDIENCE: Decay or [INAUDIBLE]

1937
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:25,740
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

1938
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:28,830
It can decay, it can be
absorbed by a neutron

1939
01:28:28,830 --> 01:28:31,326
to become something
we don't care about.

1940
01:28:31,326 --> 01:28:33,460
Let's see, let's
call it cross-section

1941
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:41,380
2 null times flux times
N2 minus the cross-section

1942
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:44,130
from 2 to 0, just this
term with a minus sign.

1943
01:28:48,567 --> 01:28:50,300
How about N3?

1944
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:52,396
What are all the
ways we can make N3?

1945
01:28:55,702 --> 01:28:57,077
Could you say it
a little louder?

1946
01:28:57,077 --> 01:28:58,178
AUDIENCE: Only from decay.

1947
01:28:58,178 --> 01:28:59,470
MICHAEL SHORT: Only from decay.

1948
01:28:59,470 --> 01:29:02,020
Again, just see which
arrows are pointing at it.

1949
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:06,225
And what about the
destruction mechanism for N3?

1950
01:29:06,225 --> 01:29:08,030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1951
01:29:08,030 --> 01:29:09,030
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

1952
01:29:09,030 --> 01:29:11,890
So there's some probability
it decays, let's say,

1953
01:29:11,890 --> 01:29:19,800
cross-section 3 null times
flux times N3 minus this arrow

1954
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,960
going back to N1.

1955
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:25,210
Running out of space,
too many units.

1956
01:29:25,210 --> 01:29:31,450
From 3 to 1 flux N3.

1957
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:35,530
So the point of accepting the
escalation of this problem

1958
01:29:35,530 --> 01:29:37,240
into something crazy
is that it doesn't

1959
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:39,010
matter how crazy it gets.

1960
01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:42,190
As long as you have like an
arrow-based diagram or a flow

1961
01:29:42,190 --> 01:29:45,820
chart to say which isotopes
become which other isotopes

1962
01:29:45,820 --> 01:29:49,720
by which other means, you
can pose and correctly write

1963
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:52,390
the set of equations
that defines them.

1964
01:29:52,390 --> 01:29:55,450
This is when I would bring
in MATLAB or Mathematica.

1965
01:29:55,450 --> 01:29:57,080
I could make you do
this analytically,

1966
01:29:57,080 --> 01:30:00,090
but this isn't a
course 18 class and--

1967
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:01,844
yeah, we don't want to go there.

1968
01:30:01,844 --> 01:30:04,060
Cool.

1969
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:06,240
So I think--

1970
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:09,660
I guess it's probably
getting towards 10 of 10 of.

1971
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:11,220
Close enough.

1972
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:14,790
It's like three of 10 of.

1973
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:18,910
So I'd like to open it up to any
questions because we let this--

1974
01:30:18,910 --> 01:30:22,240
I let this escalate freely to
prove the point that as long

1975
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:23,680
as you know what
decays into what

1976
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:25,600
or what creates
or destroys what,

1977
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,980
you can set up the
equations correctly.

1978
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:31,800
What we'll be doing on
Tuesday is graphing this.

1979
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:34,920
Where we can pose an arbitrarily
complex set of equations

1980
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:38,010
and you can start looking
at, well, the change in one

1981
01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:40,130
depends on the
amount of the other,

1982
01:30:40,130 --> 01:30:42,900
and you can almost graphically
solve this on paper.

1983
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:45,878
Forget Mathematica in MATLAB.

1984
01:30:45,878 --> 01:30:47,670
If you look at last
year's exam, I actually

1985
01:30:47,670 --> 01:30:49,080
posed a more
complex set of these

1986
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:52,030
and said draw the solution.

1987
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:54,710
And I'm going to-- we're going
to show you how to do that.

1988
01:30:54,710 --> 01:30:59,175
But any question on
how we formed these?

1989
01:30:59,175 --> 01:31:00,165
Yep?

1990
01:31:00,165 --> 01:31:02,145
AUDIENCE: What is sigma again?

1991
01:31:02,145 --> 01:31:03,640
I'm sorry.

1992
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:06,400
MICHAEL SHORT: So we just
said let's say N3 decays

1993
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,862
to some isotope we
don't care about.

1994
01:31:08,862 --> 01:31:10,570
That's how I initially
had it, and then I

1995
01:31:10,570 --> 01:31:12,600
think Luke said, well
can N2 become N0?

1996
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:14,260
And I said, yeah, sure.

1997
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:17,090
So there can be a cross-section
for every type of reaction.

1998
01:31:17,090 --> 01:31:20,350
So in reality, you might have
any reaction under the sun,

1999
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:21,220
right?

2000
01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:23,290
One isotope could absorb
a neutron and decay

2001
01:31:23,290 --> 01:31:25,600
by like any three or
four different mechanisms

2002
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,297
into something else.

2003
01:31:27,297 --> 01:31:28,797
You may have different
probabilities

2004
01:31:28,797 --> 01:31:30,288
for each of these.

2005
01:31:34,261 --> 01:31:34,761
Yeah?

2006
01:31:34,761 --> 01:31:40,665
AUDIENCE: Do those decay
constants [INAUDIBLE]

2007
01:31:40,665 --> 01:31:42,290
MICHAEL SHORT: The
only time I'd expect

2008
01:31:42,290 --> 01:31:44,630
you to find these decay
constants is if I told you

2009
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:46,400
what these isotopes were.

2010
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:49,190
Those are also listed on
the table of nuclides.

2011
01:31:49,190 --> 01:31:52,610
As in they give
you the half-life,

2012
01:31:52,610 --> 01:31:54,800
and you know from this
half-life relation

2013
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:57,350
what the decay constant is.

2014
01:31:57,350 --> 01:32:00,243
If I didn't tell you
what these isotopes were,

2015
01:32:00,243 --> 01:32:01,910
I would just have you
keep these symbols

2016
01:32:01,910 --> 01:32:03,710
as lambda 1 and lambda 2.

2017
01:32:03,710 --> 01:32:06,830
And I might pose a question
which will solve graphically

2018
01:32:06,830 --> 01:32:09,110
on Tuesday, like
let's say, solve

2019
01:32:09,110 --> 01:32:12,320
this set of equations
for lambda 2

2020
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,203
is much greater than lambda 1.

2021
01:32:14,203 --> 01:32:15,620
I don't care what
the numbers are,

2022
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:18,700
let's just look at
that general relation.

2023
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:21,430
And all the graphs for
that sort of situation

2024
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:26,140
will follow the same pattern.

2025
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:27,640
Cool.

2026
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:29,860
Any other questions on how
we constructed this set

2027
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:32,190
of differential equations?

2028
01:32:32,190 --> 01:32:34,820
And know that I'll never
ask you to solve them

2029
01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:38,020
numerically or analytically.

2030
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:38,520
Yeah.

2031
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:43,060
That's why we have computers
and this is the future.

2032
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:45,492
These I might expect you
to know how to derive,

2033
01:32:45,492 --> 01:32:47,117
but this is the
simplest possible case.

2034
01:32:52,254 --> 01:32:54,445
All right, if
there's no questions,

2035
01:32:54,445 --> 01:32:56,070
then let's take
another 10-minute break

2036
01:32:56,070 --> 01:33:00,100
and I'll be here for recitation
to go over whatever problems

2037
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:02,250
you guys would like to do.
