8
00:00:21,427 --> 00:00:23,760
MICHAEL SHORT: We've actually
got a special guest today.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,430
It's Jake Hecla, one
of the seniors at NSE

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,060
who's gone on to Chernobyl for
the second time, just returned

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,450
from there two weeks ago.

12
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,060
So if you remember
on Tuesday, we

13
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,160
went through all of the
physics and intuition

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,630
about why Chernobyl happened.

15
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,280
And we left off on what
does it look like today.

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,905
So Jake is going to tell you
what does it look like today.

17
00:00:41,905 --> 00:00:43,530
JAKE HECLA: All right,
so first off I'm

18
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,020
actually going to go over a bit
of the reactor physics involved

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,980
with the Chernobyl accident.

20
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,050
I realize you guys have already
covered this to some extent.

21
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,500
But I didn't plan for that.

22
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,697
So it's in my presentation.

23
00:00:51,697 --> 00:00:53,280
MICHAEL SHORT: It'll
be a good review.

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,990
JAKE HECLA: Yes, also
I am a little sick.

25
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,040
So I'm probably going to
start coughing, apologies.

26
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,970
I'm not dying.

27
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:00,870
It's just a cold.

28
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,152
AUDIENCE: Radiation poisoning.

29
00:01:02,152 --> 00:01:04,319
JAKE HECLA: I have heard
that joke about eight times

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,194
in the last two days.

31
00:01:05,194 --> 00:01:06,210
And I'm so done with it.

32
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,233
But yes, it's not
radiation poisoning.

33
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:09,150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

34
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,820
JAKE HECLA: Yeah, all
right, where is Chernobyl?

35
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,790
Ah, dang it.

36
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,260
Come on, no, go the other
way, the other way, yep.

37
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,930
OK, there.

38
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,960
OK, so one of the
first questions

39
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,720
I got when I said I'm going to
go and visit Chernobyl is wait,

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,280
isn't that a war zone?

41
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,180
Not quite.

42
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,800
So the Ukrainian,
the war in Ukraine

43
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,880
is mostly in this
portion over here.

44
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,180
It's not entirely under
Rebel control in that area.

45
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,830
And I say "rebel"
in quotation marks

46
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,310
because rebel means Russian.

47
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,440
However, if you
notice those arrows,

48
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,990
Russian forces are built
up all along that border.

49
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,530
So while it's not
an active war zone,

50
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,540
it's certainly not a
place to be spending

51
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,820
a large amount of time.

52
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:04,770
That said, Chernobyl is
north of Kiev by about,

53
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,449
I don't know, let's see,
200, 250 kilometers.

54
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:14,670
So it's not completely
out in the sticks, right.

55
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,940
Hopefully this gives you good
sense of roughly where it is.

56
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,310
All right, so what is the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant

57
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,630
look like?

58
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,420
It consists of four
finished reactors.

59
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,940
There are two unfinished
reactors, unit 5 and 6, that

60
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,710
are not shown in this image.

61
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:34,640
Units 1 and 2 are
located at the right.

62
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,290
Those were constructed in
the 1970s and early 1980s.

63
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,090
All of these reactors
or the RBMK type.

64
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,560
Units 1 and 2 operated
with some success--

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,530
I'll go into that later--

66
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:55,110
for a number of years before the
accident that happened in 1986.

67
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,900
We also had some call
outs up here that

68
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,560
show the, some of the
incidents that I'll

69
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,870
talk about here a little bit
later in the presentation.

70
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,670
But this just gives you a
general idea of the layout.

71
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:11,060
So it's two separate
buildings for units 1 and 2.

72
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,690
And then units 3 and 4 are in
one building, all connected

73
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,640
by this turbo generator hall.

74
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,490
So this is where
the generators that

75
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,420
turn the steam from
the RBMK into power, r.

76
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,420
This is one giant--

77
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,420
well, before the accident, this
was one giant, not separated

78
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,660
hallway, basically.

79
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:36,130
So you could walk from one end
to the other, theoretically.

80
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,135
All right, so what is an RBMK?

81
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:43,210
An RBMK is a light water-cooled,
graphite-moderated,

82
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,900
channel-type reactor.

83
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,860
This means that it does not
have a giant pressure vessel

84
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,430
like you would see in a VVER
or an equivalent American

85
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,590
light water reactor.

86
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,860
Why does that mean anything?

87
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,120
Well, building giant pressure
vessels is very difficult.

88
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,490
If any of you've done
research on manufacturing

89
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,980
of nuclear reactors,
you'll find out

90
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,772
that the equipment necessary
to construct a reactor

91
00:04:05,772 --> 00:04:07,480
pressure vessel is
not actually something

92
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,850
we even have in the US anymore.

93
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,820
Is it Korea that
does it for us now?

94
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,195
MICHAEL SHORT:
Japan Steel Works.

95
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:15,550
JAKE HECLA: Japan
that does it now.

96
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,790
In the Soviet times, it
was very, very difficult

97
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,860
for the Soviet Union to
produce such pressure vessels

98
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,480
at any kind of reasonable rate.

99
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,680
So the RBMK got
around this by using

100
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,500
individual channels that were
their own pressure vessel,

101
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,650
so to speak.

102
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,700
So the way this works is, let's
just start on the cold side.

103
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,240
You take in cold water, goes
here through these things.

104
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,340
These are main
circulating pumps--

105
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,990
MCPs, as you'll
see them referred

106
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,760
to later in the presentation--

107
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,930
goes up through the
bottom up the core.

108
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,440
These are the hot fuel rods.

109
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,060
The water goes from liquid
to steam phase as it's

110
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,290
flowing through the
channels, comes out the top,

111
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,260
goes to the steam
water separators.

112
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,810
Steam goes to the turbines,
turns the turbines,

113
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,460
makes electricity.

114
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,860
The important thing
to remember here

115
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,950
is that we've got a
giant graphite core.

116
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,840
The graphite is what
is doing the moderating

117
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,010
in this circumstance.

118
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,220
It is not the water.

119
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,990
This allows you to run
very low-enriched uranium.

120
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,880
So you could
theoretically run an RBMK

121
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,340
on I believe it was 1.2 percent
was as low as they could go.

122
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,150
But regardless, extremely
low-enriched uranium,

123
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,650
which is convenient if you don't
want to waste a lot of time

124
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,400
enriching uranium.

125
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,110
The problem with this is
that you have a giant core.

126
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,150
If you recall the scattering
cross-section for graphite,

127
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,880
it's pretty small.

128
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,040
And the amount of energy
lost per collision

129
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,470
is likewise also fairly small.

130
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,360
So the core on this thing
is, let's see, 11, yeah,

131
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,030
11.5 meters across.

132
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:04,480
The core for an equivalent
American reactor--

133
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,180
so well, there is no
real equivalent to this--

134
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,720
but for, let's say,
an AP 1000 reactor

135
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,680
of equivalent electrical output,
is about four meters across.

136
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,705
So the core is huge.

137
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,520
As I already discussed, this
is what the individual pressure

138
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,540
channels look like.

139
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,020
So cool water comes in the
bottom, goes by the fuel rods,

140
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,240
pops out the top.

141
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,720
The RBMK had some
serious design flaws.

142
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,610
So as I said, the core is huge.

143
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,590
This allows local
power anomalies

144
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,950
to form really, really easily.

145
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,900
If you look at the
core, one portion

146
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,690
can be kind of neutronically
separated from the others

147
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:51,010
because neutrons just don't
make it all that far when

148
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,150
diffusing across the core.

149
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,400
So you can have very, very
high power in one corner

150
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,060
and very low power in the other,
which is not something that

151
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,170
can develop in a physically
smaller core, which

152
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:05,410
has a characteristic
scale equivalent to that

153
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,790
of the neutron being free path.

154
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,460
Further, the encore flux
monitoring on the RBMK

155
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,530
is seriously deficient.

156
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,260
So there are a variety
of neutron detectors

157
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,630
that exist around the
periphery of the core.

158
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,510
But they're wholly insufficient
to catch these local power

159
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,920
anomalies.

160
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,170
Chernobyl actually found out
the hard way on this one.

161
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:32,420
In 1982, unit 1 suffered a
quote "localized core melt,"

162
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,410
not really something that
can happen in LWR, really

163
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,000
any other type of reactor.

164
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,800
But a couple of
the fuel channels

165
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,320
actually experienced
one of these local power

166
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,060
anomalies and ended up melting.

167
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,660
So if you go into the
control room of unit 1,

168
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,760
you can see that on the fuel
channel cartogram on the wall,

169
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,870
there are two of them that
are just Sharpied out.

170
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,810
And those are the
ones that melted.

171
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,917
Further, it has a positive
void reactivity coefficient.

172
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:00,750
What does that mean?

173
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,950
Well, when the water
boils in the core,

174
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,380
the density of the
water there goes down.

175
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,660
And the power of
the reactor ends up

176
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,940
going up because the
water is primarily

177
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,910
acting not as moderator
but as a neutron absorber.

178
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,230
This is bad for a whole
variety of reasons.

179
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,570
And they found out
quite catastrophically

180
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,400
in 1986 exactly why.

181
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,390
Further, the system is
extremely unstable at low power.

182
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,580
So how did the 1986
accident happen?

183
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,700
It was part of this thing called
a turbo generator rundown test.

184
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,200
The general idea is that if you
have an off-site power failure,

185
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,650
and your main circulating
pumps are no longer

186
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,447
have off-site power,
you somehow need

187
00:08:49,447 --> 00:08:51,280
to keep water flowing
through the core, such

188
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,950
that the fuel does not melt.

189
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,580
The problem is that the backup,
large diesel generators,

190
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,180
are just that.

191
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,030
They're large.

192
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,040
They're diesel.

193
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,600
And therefore they're
very, very slow

194
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,720
to come online and
come up to full power.

195
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,790
The way that you
can bridge this gap

196
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,360
is by using the energy that
you've stored in the turbines

197
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,760
to effectively power the
main circulating pumps

198
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,940
until the diesel generators
can come up online.

199
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,840
When unit 4 was fully
constructed in 1983

200
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,410
and turned on for
the first time,

201
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,250
they had never
actually done this test

202
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,210
where they did a turbo
generator rundown,

203
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,970
despite the fact that it was
required by law in the Soviet

204
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,670
Union that all new
power stations should

205
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,370
have this test performed.

206
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,890
It was delayed until 1986.

207
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:43,940
And yeah, it was delayed until
1986 is the long story short.

208
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,720
The test procedure-- sorry for
all the text on this slide--

209
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,440
is basically as follows.

210
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,320
So you would ramp
the reactor down.

211
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,810
So you would bring it from
a normal thermal output

212
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:56,230
of up to 2,400
megawatts thermal,

213
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,240
down to 600 or 700 megawatts.

214
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,378
You'd bring the turbo
generators up to full speed.

215
00:10:01,378 --> 00:10:02,920
So you'd store as
much energy in them

216
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,910
as you possibly could, then
cut off the steam supply such

217
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,760
that now you are just extracting
energy from the spinning turbo

218
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,242
generator.

219
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:13,450
This would then be used to
power the main circulating

220
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,930
pumps, each of which
took about 40 megawatts.

221
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,180
There are eight of them total.

222
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:23,950
I believe six could be
used for normal operation.

223
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,080
The rundown would take
somewhere in the range

224
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,940
of 60 to 70 seconds.

225
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,010
And hopefully by this time
your diesel generators

226
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,690
would be turned
on, pumping water,

227
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,740
and everything would be fine.

228
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,940
What happened in the test
was decidedly quite different

229
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,840
from that.

230
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:43,420
So on April 26,
1986, they attempted

231
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,390
to begin this test about
six hours behind schedule

232
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,360
because there was an incident
in another part of Ukraine,

233
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,550
in which a coal power
plant went offline.

234
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,450
So what happened
was the authority

235
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,450
for the grid in the area
ordered that Chernobyl

236
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:03,970
should stay online at full power
for an additional six hours.

237
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,730
They began the test by
bringing power down.

238
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:11,470
But as a result of running
for an extra six hours,

239
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,260
they'd built up a significant
amount of xenon precursors

240
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,290
in the core.

241
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,890
So when they started
turning the power down,

242
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:21,160
the power started going
down, and down, and down.

243
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:26,050
And they were unable
to arrest its drop.

244
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,680
What ended up happening was that
the power dropped all the way

245
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,870
down to 30 megawatts thermal.

246
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,330
And the reactor operators
kind of panicked.

247
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:38,350
Their response to this,
instead of canceling the test,

248
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,570
was to pull out as
many control rods

249
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,220
as they could get
their hands on.

250
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:42,940
They did so.

251
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,840
And this managed to rescue the
thermal output of the reactor.

252
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,170
And it bumped up to around
200 megawatts thermal.

253
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,440
At this point, the reactor was
in an extremely unstable state.

254
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,170
Mind you, almost all of the rods
that they could get their hands

255
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,150
on were out of the reactor.

256
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,950
The only thing
keeping reactivity

257
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,600
at a reasonable level
was all the xenon

258
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,660
that was built up in the core.

259
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,410
At this point, they began the
turbo generator run down test.

260
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:14,110
They shut off steam to the main
turbine, or one of the turbines

261
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,560
after it was run
up to full power,

262
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,350
and then attempted to run
the main circulating pump.

263
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,500
The main circulating pump
started drawing down the energy

264
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,040
from the spinning turbine.

265
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,590
And as a result, it
ran slower and slower,

266
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,360
meaning that the
flow through the core

267
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,100
was less and less, more water
boiled, going into steam,

268
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,310
which increased the reactivity.

269
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:43,210
As a result, the power
output of the court went up.

270
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,830
It burned out more xenon.

271
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,200
And the cycle continued.

272
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,900
They noticed a power
excursion, about 40 seconds

273
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,440
after they began the
test and at this point

274
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,210
recognize they were
in bad territory

275
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,430
and hit the scram button.

276
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,220
This would jam pretty much all
of the available control rods

277
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,530
into the core, including
some emergency extras,

278
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,330
and shut everything down.

279
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:07,060
In most circumstances, this
would be a fairly safe move.

280
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,830
But in the case of the RBMK
it was most certainly not.

281
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:16,150
RBMK control rods have
a graphite tip on them.

282
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,570
When jammed into the core,
they caused a localized power

283
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,990
increase because the graphite
is a great moderator.

284
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,055
And it is displacing water,
which is a great absorber.

285
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,180
And as a result, after they
made it a couple meters

286
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,260
into the core, the
increased pressure

287
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:36,280
in the core from the
power output, which

288
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,530
was localized around the
tips the control rods,

289
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:42,490
ended up shattering the
control rod drive mechanisms.

290
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:47,290
And instead of turning off, the
cycle basically just continued,

291
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,990
power continued to ramp up over
the next couple of seconds.

292
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,630
It eventually reached
somewhere around 10 to 20

293
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,720
times the maximum rated
thermal output of the system.

294
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,490
And a massive steam
explosion ended up

295
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,800
ripping through the facility.

296
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,310
It tossed the 2000
ton biological shield

297
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,150
on top of the reactor through
the roof of the facility.

298
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,970
It injected a significant
portion of the fuel,

299
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,460
as well as the
moderator in the core.

300
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,717
And it started a massive
fire around the facility.

301
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,825
Just to give you a
good sense of scale,

302
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:22,810
let's see, if I've got
the virtual laser pointer.

303
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:27,040
That's a person right
here, this little guy.

304
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,980
This is the top of
the biological shield,

305
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,380
Elena shield.

306
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:37,420
And then this is a model, a
cutaway model of the Chernobyl

307
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,410
reactor facility
with the shield,

308
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:46,140
and with the flipped shield
that went up through the roof

309
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,760
and came back down.

310
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,780
So as you can see, it was an
utterly massive explosion.

311
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,480
So the damage to the reactor was
immediately quite catastrophic.

312
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,340
Moderator blocks,
fuel was spread

313
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,290
all around the immediate area.

314
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,910
If you look in this photo,
it's rather difficult to see.

315
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,330
But at the bottom of
that column of smoke

316
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:11,410
you can actually see the bottom
up the biological shield.

317
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,660
Kind of gives you a
sense of the scale

318
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,840
of the damage to the reactor.

319
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,340
After the explosion happened,
actually none of the operators

320
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,713
believe the reactor breached
confinement in any way.

321
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,380
They didn't really
have an immediate way

322
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,120
of seeing what had happened.

323
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,580
So they open the door and went
to the main turbo generator

324
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,320
building to
investigate the damage.

325
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,590
They believed it was perhaps one
or two ruptured fuel channels.

326
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,683
As it happened at, I
believe the Leningrad,

327
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,100
I think it was the
Leningrad power

328
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,333
station a few years earlier.

329
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,000
In the few seconds
that they were there,

330
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,760
they received fatal doses
and died in the hospital

331
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,040
in May of 1986.

332
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,040
This is a photo from
control room of reactor 4,

333
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,760
showing a jammed control rod
drive at the 6 meter position.

334
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,520
So this was probably
a rod, let's see,

335
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:00,340
this is probably a rod coming
up from the bottom, in that it,

336
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,020
seven meters would
be all the way out.

337
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,520
Zero meters would
be all the way in.

338
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,230
The initial response to
this, despite the fact

339
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,780
that the reactor
operators were not

340
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,610
yet dead, did
realize that it was

341
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,500
a full breach of
containment, was

342
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,300
the response was to an accident
that was non-nuclear in nature.

343
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,740
So when the fire department
got a call from the authority

344
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,580
at Chernobyl, the message
that they received

345
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,490
was there's a fire at
the reactor complex.

346
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,400
As a result, what
they showed up with

347
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:38,510
was not equipment suitable for
a hazmat situation in any way.

348
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,160
That said, there's
pretty much nothing

349
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,778
that could shield anyone from
the extremely high radiation

350
00:16:43,778 --> 00:16:45,320
field that one would
encounter around

351
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,820
the reactor in the immediate
aftermath of the accident.

352
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:54,200
But nonetheless, they
were extremely vulnerable.

353
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,240
It was night when this
accident happened.

354
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,870
As I mentioned, this happened
at 1:23 in the morning.

355
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,960
They actually couldn't see
the extent of the accident.

356
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,060
And they initially
believed that it was just

357
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,585
a fire on the roof of the
turbo generator building.

358
00:17:07,585 --> 00:17:08,960
They attempted to
fight the fire.

359
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,619
And some of them
actually succumb

360
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:14,000
to acute radiation poisoning,
or acute radiation syndrome,

361
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,910
almost immediately.

362
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,810
A number of firefighters
went up on the roof

363
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:19,893
and just didn't come back.

364
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,589
The aftermath of the
accident, the cleanup

365
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:29,380
was handled by the Soviet Army.

366
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,330
The people that were
involved in this

367
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,910
were known as the liquidators.

368
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,450
They would spend several minutes
on the rooftop of the turbo

369
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,840
generator building, or up
near where the reactor was,

370
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,730
the reactor containment
building was.

371
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:48,440
And they would receive a,
effectively a lifetime dose,

372
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,750
which I believe was, I believe
their limit was 50 REM.

373
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,230
And that would be a couple
of minutes up there.

374
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:01,060
Let's see, this photo doesn't
show much evidence of it.

375
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,498
But I suppose it shows a
little bit of evidence of it.

376
00:18:03,498 --> 00:18:05,290
If you look around the
bottom up the frame,

377
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,970
you can actually
see a little bit

378
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:09,310
of hazing in kind of
a periodic fashion.

379
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:15,440
Let's see if I can get my
pointer on it here, here, here,

380
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,570
here, and here.

381
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:19,810
That's the gear that
moves the film is actually

382
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:23,590
shielding the film
from radiation

383
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,360
exposure at those points.

384
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,880
The radiation dose rate
was so high up there

385
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,070
that most of the pictures
that were taken just

386
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,590
didn't turn out whatsoever.

387
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,160
A few smarter photographers
used a whole lot of lead

388
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,060
and were able to capture
photos like this.

389
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,990
But nonetheless, the dose
rates were tremendous.

390
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,780
The reactor structure itself
was entombed in this thing

391
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,000
that we call the sarcophagus.

392
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,940
People in Ukraine call
it the object shelter,

393
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,330
or the shelter object.

394
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,810
It was constructed in
starting almost immediately

395
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:01,790
after the accident, basically
to keep radioactive graphite

396
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,300
and fuel fragments from
leaving the reactor structure

397
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,800
and contaminating any more land.

398
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,750
This is a photo from when
it was under construction.

399
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,080
Basically what it consisted of
were steel and concrete walls

400
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,290
that were erected
around the reactor,

401
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,360
using a variety of technologies.

402
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,290
They at first attempted
to use robots,

403
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,860
that were almost
immediately rendered useless

404
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,350
by the high radiation field.

405
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:35,000
Later on, they ended up using
quote "bio robots," people,

406
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,720
to move things into place.

407
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,820
As I've said before,
a whole lot of people

408
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:46,250
died in this accident both
immediately and after,

409
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,550
many during the construction
of the sarcophagus.

410
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,560
Actually during the
initial firefighting,

411
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,930
or yeah, the initial
firefighting measures,

412
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,780
as the core remained burning
for a number of weeks

413
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,470
after the accident,
they attempted

414
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:04,610
to put it out with bags of
sand dropped from helicopters.

415
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:08,090
And during that effort,
a helicopter actually

416
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,680
ended up hitting
one of the cranes

417
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,600
that they were attempting
to use for this

418
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,360
and falling into the
reactor, and a good portion

419
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,390
of its remains remain entombed
within the sarcophagus,

420
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:21,130
from what I understand.

421
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:24,710
All right, so my visit to
Chernobyl, why would anyone

422
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,360
ever want to go there?

423
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,980
The primary focus
was to learn about

424
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,220
radiological
decontamination at the site,

425
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,250
basically how is
contamination control managed,

426
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,588
how do workers stay safe.

427
00:20:35,588 --> 00:20:37,130
Mind you, there are
3,000 people that

428
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:40,160
go to work there every day.

429
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,630
And what are the strengths?

430
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,495
And what are the shortcomings
of their radiological program?

431
00:20:44,495 --> 00:20:49,010
It was seven days total,
four of which were on site.

432
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:52,970
Other days were spent
in Pripyat as well as

433
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:57,320
in some classroom training,
which I've got great photos of.

434
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,260
So this is a slide stolen
directly from the PowerPoint

435
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,730
that I was sent on day one.

436
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:06,650
But this was organized by
three people, Carl Willis,

437
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,810
Erik Kambarian, and Ed Geist.

438
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,400
I've known Carl for
a few years now.

439
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,070
He lives in
Albuquerque, New Mexico

440
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,530
and is a radiation safety
officer at a company

441
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:20,030
that, I think they do advanced
energy storage technologies.

442
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,070
I'm not exactly sure.

443
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:26,300
Erik is a firefighter and
specializes in radiation

444
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,500
emergency response.

445
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,830
And Edward works at
the Rand Corporation

446
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:33,935
and does nuclear history and
nuclear security research.

447
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,760
This is the team this year.

448
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,880
So we've got, let's start here.

449
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,570
This is Lucas.

450
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,300
He does environmental
radiation monitoring.

451
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,990
That's me after having no sleep
because I did a 22.611 p-set

452
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,770
the night before.

453
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:51,270
I know.

454
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,160
I looked so happy to be there.

455
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,360
This is Nathan.

456
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,340
Nathan builds organs, as
in the musical instrument.

457
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,900
He was along because
he's always been

458
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,720
interested in Chernobyl
but didn't really have

459
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,480
any experience in the field.

460
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,070
This is Stanislaus.

461
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:11,670
Stanislaus was our guide
from the Chernobyl authority.

462
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,860
He's been working at
the plant since 1991

463
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,400
and is a fantastic
resource for information.

464
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,240
This is Ed, who I believe
I talked about earlier.

465
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,260
And this is Ryan Pierce.

466
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,670
I'm not really
sure what he does.

467
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:29,310
This is Iris, who is a friend
of Carl's and works in,

468
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,500
believe radiation oncology.

469
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:37,240
And then Danell Hogan, who's
an educator based in Phoenix,

470
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,610
Arizona who works with the DOE.

471
00:22:40,857 --> 00:22:42,690
By the way if you're
wondering why we're all

472
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,760
wearing those absurd
robes before we

473
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,060
were going to go
in to another room

474
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:52,350
and change into basically
coveralls, which

475
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,295
are easy to decontaminate.

476
00:22:55,295 --> 00:22:56,670
One of the activities
that we did

477
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,890
was real decontamination
training.

478
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:02,610
So that is a truck from
the Novarka work site,

479
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:06,300
which, by the way, that is
me with a Geiger counter.

480
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,970
I'm surveying for contamination.

481
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,357
We then pressure
washed the truck.

482
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,440
As it turns out, there's
a very specific technique

483
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,815
one needs to use for pressure
washing when you're dealing

484
00:23:15,815 --> 00:23:19,650
with a contaminated object, so
as to not blast contaminated

485
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,180
dirt up back onto the truck.

486
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,480
This was a very interesting
experience and also

487
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,120
one that was very entertaining
for the workers involved,

488
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,300
because they don't actually
wear that when they're

489
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:35,100
doing decontamination because
their respect for safety

490
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,220
protocols are, shall we
say, a bit different.

491
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,950
So they got to see us
where the absurd rubber

492
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:46,890
ducky suits while they stood
by smoking and laughing at us.

493
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,810
I believe you can actually see
the corner of that guy's jacket

494
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:50,310
back there.

495
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,860
And he's just wearing
everyday clothes.

496
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,640
We also went on the new
safe confinement work site.

497
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,160
So I haven't talked about it
earlier in this presentation,

498
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,440
but I suppose I should have.

499
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,640
There is a object called
the New Safe Confinement

500
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,890
Arch that consists of basically
a giant stainless steel

501
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:16,940
structure on rails which is
being slid over reactor 4

502
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,490
so as to prevent the spread
of any sort of contamination

503
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,780
from it.

504
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,550
This is known as the New Safe
Confinement, or NSC, arch.

505
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,430
It's been under
construction since 2007.

506
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:31,580
And it just moved
for the first time,

507
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:36,860
actually while I was there,
so on the 12th of November.

508
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,940
It's supposed to
last for 100 years.

509
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,830
And hopefully in that
kind of time span

510
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:46,430
they'll be able to take apart
what remains of the reactor.

511
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:51,770
So actually what you see here is
the corner of the sarcophagus.

512
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:55,430
And then if you were to pan
over this way a little bit,

513
00:24:55,430 --> 00:25:00,350
you'd see the right set
of tracks for the New Safe

514
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:03,040
Confinement Arch.

515
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,803
We also did some
classroom training.

516
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:07,220
Admittedly, the
classroom training

517
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,490
was the most disappointing
part of this.

518
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,130
The instructors were
not particularly

519
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,740
interested in showing
us really anything

520
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:21,380
other than YouTube videos and
other things that would just

521
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,760
waste our time.

522
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,267
That was the one part of this
trip that I did not enjoy.

523
00:25:26,267 --> 00:25:28,100
Regardless, we did get
to learn a little bit

524
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,240
about the various hazmat
getups that folks would

525
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,280
wear when working on site.

526
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:41,050
As I mentioned we also
got to visit Pripyat,

527
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,090
which I have more
photos of later,

528
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,970
as well as the reactor
4 control room, which

529
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:50,290
is inside the sarcophagus,
which is quite a treat to visit.

530
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,870
The reactor 4
control room is not

531
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:56,080
terribly contaminated as a
result of the decontamination

532
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,190
efforts.

533
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,050
During the accident,
the dose rate

534
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:03,100
would have been somewhere in the
range of 5 to 10 rem an hour.

535
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,580
But today, it's in the
range of 10 mrem an hour.

536
00:26:09,078 --> 00:26:10,620
This is the New Safe
Confinement Arch

537
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,828
that I've been talking about.

538
00:26:11,828 --> 00:26:15,390
This is actually a photo from
2015 with a clip art Statue

539
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:18,210
of Liberty on it, but to
give you an idea of how huge

540
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:24,240
it is, 5 meters taller
than the Statue of Liberty.

541
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,680
And it's on rails,
which is interesting.

542
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,530
It's actually too
big for wheels.

543
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,560
So it's not on rails
like with wheels on them.

544
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,585
It's on rails with
giant Teflon scoots.

545
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,355
This is the inside of the
turbo generator hallway.

546
00:26:39,355 --> 00:26:41,230
Remember that long
building that I showed you

547
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:44,980
that connected reactors
1 and 2 and 3 and 4?

548
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,530
This is right outside
the reactor 3 part of it.

549
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,680
There are-- I think I'll
show you these photos later.

550
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,870
There are chunks of the
turbine from reactor 4

551
00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:01,090
that are down here in this
area that are quite visibly

552
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:05,080
radioactive and are very easy
to detect if one swings a Geiger

553
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,340
counter about.

554
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:10,490
Within Pripyat we also
visited a hospital 126,

555
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,970
which is where the
firefighters went immediately

556
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:18,010
after the accident, that is, the
ones that made it off the roof.

557
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:21,352
This garment here,
we're not exactly

558
00:27:21,352 --> 00:27:22,810
sure what it was
because none of us

559
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,130
were going to really touch it.

560
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:27,250
But we think it might have
been part of a cover--

561
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,720
it would go under one's helmet--

562
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,120
was extremely radioactive.

563
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,680
It was contaminated with
alpha, beta, and gamma,

564
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
which is fairly unusual.

565
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,550
Alpha contamination is fairly
rare around the Chernobyl site,

566
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:43,390
and was somewhere around 50
to 75 mR an hour on contact.

567
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,090
I think I already showed
you photos the control room.

568
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,920
Yep, unit 4, that's
the cartogram,

569
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,890
so that would display various
parameters of the reactor

570
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:00,570
for each fuel channel, depending
on how one configured it.

571
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,550
That's an external photo
of the sarcophagus.

572
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:09,540
And I think that's it for
the PowerPoint slides.

573
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,750
I do have a bunch of
photos though that I think

574
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,320
you will find interesting.

575
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,300
I apologize if it's a
little disorganized.

576
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:22,890
This was put together relatively
recently because, well, I

577
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,930
just got back from Chernobyl.

578
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,520
And then I went to a conference.

579
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,250
And then I came back here
and tried to get work done.

580
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,270
Right, so these are in
chronological order roughly.

581
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,370
I'll go through and
hopefully tell you guys

582
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:38,015
a little bit about
what the site's like.

583
00:28:38,015 --> 00:28:39,140
MICHAEL SHORT: [INAUDIBLE].

584
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:42,000
JAKE HECLA: OK, so
this is on day one.

585
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,470
We're driving to the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant site.

586
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,630
That blue and white
bus is pretty much

587
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,610
what everyone uses for
transport around there.

588
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,030
All right, so we're
not really supposed

589
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,350
to be taking photos
in this area.

590
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,850
So everything is
tilted because it's

591
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:00,610
taking them out the window
with the camera like that.

592
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:03,130
That's the New Safe
Confinement Arch.

593
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,630
It's in considerably
better shape

594
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,580
than it was last
year at this time.

595
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,190
They have done a fantastic
job of putting it together.

596
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:13,290
It's actually almost a
year ahead of schedule.

597
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,140
There it is, again.

598
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:17,230
You can see the sarcophagus
with the new support wall,

599
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:20,730
which is that right there.

600
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,280
All right, so this is our
excursion into Pripyat

601
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,990
on our second day.

602
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:37,020
So this is the group
led by Stanislaus.

603
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:40,500
As you can see, there's
not very much left.

604
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,780
Just in comparison to
what we saw last year,

605
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,990
the number of buildings
that had been taken apart

606
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:51,210
for scrap metal, illegally,
of course, was pretty huge.

607
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,925
In, I don't know,
5 or 10 years, it's

608
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:55,300
going to be very difficult to
see much of Pripyat at all,

609
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,850
frankly.

610
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,210
So this is a standard
apartment block in Pripyat.

611
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:03,180
As you can see, a lot
of broken windows.

612
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,793
A lot of bricks have fallen off.

613
00:30:04,793 --> 00:30:06,210
These things are
pretty dangerous.

614
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,950
A lot of tourists
do go into them.

615
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:11,060
If one decides to do a tourist
expedition to Chernobyl-- which

616
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,290
I don't particularly
recommend-- don't

617
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,415
go in the apartment blocks.

618
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:20,370
This is on the way to
one of the schools.

619
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:24,250
This is Lucas who has more
detectors than anyone I've ever

620
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:24,750
met.

621
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,710
He was wearing 7 at the time.

622
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,340
So I had to take a photo of him.

623
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,040
This is Iris imitating
some of the graffiti, which

624
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,830
unfortunately has popped
up all over the place.

625
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:38,230
Pripyat itself is
really decaying quickly.

626
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:42,180
As I've said, there's a
huge problem with looting.

627
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,680
In addition, there's
a huge problem

628
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,230
with graffiti and vandalism.

629
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,330
It's really
depressing, honestly,

630
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:54,090
to go there and see how much
has changed just in a year.

631
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,920
So despite my
earlier warning, we

632
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,150
did go in an apartment block.

633
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,780
This is just a
measurement showing

634
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,570
that the background up there
actually is not terribly high.

635
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:13,240
Yeah, that's Iris, not
particularly safety conscious

636
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,960
at times.

637
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,710
This gives you a good
idea of how far away

638
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,233
Pripyat is from the reactor.

639
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:21,025
That is not very far,
about two kilometers.

640
00:31:21,025 --> 00:31:23,050
So you can see the New
Safe Confinement Arch

641
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:26,650
to the top left of the detector.

642
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:29,650
Background there is about,
in this particular apartment

643
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:32,530
block, at this particular
time, was about four to five

644
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:36,292
times what you would see
in downtown Cambridge.

645
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,000
There are wild
animals in Pripyat

646
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,160
and the rest of
the exclusion zone.

647
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,570
This is a huge problem.

648
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,300
So despite the fact that
the cats are very cute

649
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,770
and the puppies are very
cute, they also have rabies,

650
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:54,630
not all of them, but a
very large number of them.

651
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:58,140
In 2009, five workers were
injured by, I kid you not,

652
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,412
a rabid wolf.

653
00:31:59,412 --> 00:32:00,870
There's a YouTube
video of this you

654
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:04,320
can look up on your own
time if you so wish.

655
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,300
This is because Ukraine
doesn't have a lot of money.

656
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,320
So they have not been able to
continue with their vaccination

657
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:11,820
program.

658
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:17,700
They actually use baits that
have a rabies vaccine in them

659
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:22,290
to normally suppress rabies
in wild animal populations.

660
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,820
But Ukraine doesn't
have any money.

661
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,410
They killed the program
about five years ago.

662
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:29,220
And as a result there's a
huge, huge problem with,

663
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,870
especially rabid foxes.

664
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:36,360
Because everyone thinks foxes
are cute, especially tourists.

665
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,700
And foxes, when they
get rabies, some of them

666
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,400
go through a stage in which
they appear to be very friendly.

667
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,230
As far as I know,
no one has gotten

668
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:46,770
rabies from a rabid
animal at Chernobyl.

669
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:50,250
But it's certainly
a possibility.

670
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:54,540
So Stanislaus was being a very
bad example by feeding one

671
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,480
of the wild cats.

672
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,425
So that's why I took
a picture of it.

673
00:33:00,425 --> 00:33:01,800
This is one of
the many memorials

674
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,450
that you'll find in
downtown Slavutych.

675
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,880
We stayed in the city that
was built, effectively,

676
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,530
as a replacement for Pripyat.

677
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:09,660
It's actually a fantastic town.

678
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,900
I really enjoy Slavutych.

679
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,780
And as one might expect,
there are memorials

680
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,810
everywhere because the entire
population is basically

681
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:24,060
the folks that were removed
from the town of Pripyat.

682
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,700
This is the train we
would take every day.

683
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,750
Slavutych is
separated from Pripyat

684
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:34,240
by a little isthmus of
Belarus that drops down.

685
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,040
So that's bad, because you
can't get a visa to Belarus.

686
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,240
It's not really a thing
you can do as an American.

687
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,490
I mean, you can apply for one.

688
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,310
You'll just never hear back.

689
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:46,710
Belarus is Europe's
last dictatorship.

690
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:50,830
And it's not some place one
wants to go for any reason.

691
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:54,267
So when we would get on this
train, the doors would shut.

692
00:33:54,267 --> 00:33:56,100
We would go through
Belarus and we would all

693
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,535
pray that didn't break
down because then we

694
00:33:58,535 --> 00:34:00,660
would have to spend some
time to Belarus in prison.

695
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,790
But yeah, this is the train
yard, bright and early.

696
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,130
The various zones on the
reactor site for cleanliness,

697
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,929
so to speak,
radiological cleanliness

698
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:15,325
are separated by these
benches effectively,

699
00:34:15,325 --> 00:34:18,409
that you have to step over, so
that it reminds you that, hey,

700
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:20,120
this is the clean area.

701
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,330
You need to be wearing
boot covers and at least

702
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:24,800
these garments in
order to go here.

703
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,745
Sideways, for some reason,
this is part of the--

704
00:34:32,745 --> 00:34:34,870
all right, I don't know
why these are all sideways.

705
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:37,810
But regardless, you
get the picture.

706
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:40,030
If you notice on the
top of the screen, which

707
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,409
should be the left
of the screen,

708
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:43,120
let's see if I can rotate it.

709
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,130
That's a giant puddle of water.

710
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,929
This place is falling apart.

711
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:51,520
Despite the fact
that they have money

712
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,139
from the European bank on
reconstruction and development

713
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:57,970
for the New Safe
Confinement Arch,

714
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:01,760
the Chernobyl site itself
does not have a lot of money.

715
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,210
And as a result things
are falling apart.

716
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,710
And the amount of
contamination that

717
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,290
is getting into places where
it very much shouldn't be,

718
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:11,290
like this quote "clean
area," is fairly high.

719
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:14,300
That puddle of water was pretty
toasty, something like 5 to 8

720
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,670
mR an hour on contact.

721
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,060
That's generally quite bad.

722
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,140
As I said, water is
coming in everywhere.

723
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:28,480
And in this case they were using
leg covers to catch the water.

724
00:35:31,578 --> 00:35:33,870
Another one of the hallways
that had water leak into it

725
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:36,976
and therefore all
the lights are out.

726
00:35:36,976 --> 00:35:39,170
That's the footwear
which we were issued,

727
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:43,030
which breaks after walking
about a kilometer, which is not

728
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:47,440
particularly encouraging if one
wants to take their boots back.

729
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,750
Again, walking down
the hallway, you

730
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,760
notice this gold
corrugated material

731
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,680
that you see on the sides?

732
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,350
It's aluminum that is anodized.

733
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,150
And it's placed there
because it covers up

734
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:02,350
all of the sheets of lead
that were affixed to the wall.

735
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:05,680
What happened is in the
aftermath of the accident,

736
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,710
the entire facility was just
hopelessly contaminated.

737
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,860
And you can scrub all you
want, but ultimately it's

738
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,500
very difficult to get
radioactive contamination off

739
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,360
of things.

740
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,110
So what they ended up
doing was getting it

741
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,300
down to a somewhat
acceptable level,

742
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,460
and then fastening
sheets of lead over it,

743
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,520
and then fastening this
stuff over the top of that.

744
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,160
This is unit 2's control room.

745
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,260
So this is what a fully
fleshed-out control

746
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,010
room looks like.

747
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:38,940
Unit 2 were shut down in 2000.

748
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,160
The reactors actually
continued operating

749
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,070
after the 1986
Chernobyl accident

750
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:47,580
because Ukraine was in such
desperate need of power.

751
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,730
As a result, the fuel
is still fairly hot.

752
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,640
It's producing a reasonable
amount of decay heat.

753
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,120
And there is a crew that
sits in the control room

754
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,440
at all times monitoring it.

755
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,000
That's Nathan.

756
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,750
This is actually, I
took a picture of this

757
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:08,230
because it's a very good
diagram of the Chernobyl reactor

758
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,570
that's simplified.

759
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:13,750
It shows the core and
the relative locations

760
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:19,260
of these steam,
water separators.

761
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:23,870
OK, as I said, there is a
team that stays in there.

762
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:27,670
So there are people that work
on site and work in the reactor

763
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,980
control rooms, which
I have to imagine

764
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:34,040
has to be a bit
of a surreal job.

765
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:40,340
This is inside the main, inside
the turbo generator hall.

766
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:46,970
Those chunks that you see here
are from the turbo generator

767
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:49,370
of reactor 4.

768
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:52,370
So they're quite contaminated
and quite easy to detect.

769
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,620
Actually, there is a
good story behind this.

770
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:58,370
So we were trying to
figure out exactly what was

771
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:02,930
making the dose rate so high in
the area when we were up there.

772
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:07,170
So we got a group of us to stand
in a circle, minus one person.

773
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,060
So there's a gap.

774
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,780
We got a person in the
center with a scintillator.

775
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,860
And we all kind
of rotated around

776
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,422
until we found in
which direction

777
00:38:14,422 --> 00:38:16,880
the scintillator reading was
high enough, so basically made

778
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,180
like a 2 pi meat shield.

779
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,350
It worked fairly well.

780
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:25,170
It thoroughly baffled all of
the guides that were with us.

781
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,920
They were like, what are
you doing linking arms

782
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,900
and spinning around.

783
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,240
Regardless, that is a
good way to find sources

784
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,230
if you're in a pinch.

785
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,410
This is looking
the other direction

786
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:41,250
from that same vantage
point as in the last photo.

787
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:44,010
Behind those walls with a
little radiation signs on them

788
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:49,440
are chunks of the ventilation
stack, which is fairly iconic.

789
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,870
They've been fairly
well decontaminated.

790
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:56,040
At that fence area, the
dose rate or more accurately

791
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,030
exposure rate,
was 10 mR an hour.

792
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,760
And yeah, that's another
close up photo of it.

793
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,670
And I managed to sneak by
phone over the top of it

794
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,050
and get a good shot.

795
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,210
Unfortunately, none of
the pieces are uncovered.

796
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:12,060
I would really like to
see the orange and white

797
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,490
of the ventilation stack.

798
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:17,740
But I did not.

799
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,740
Again, same shot,
slightly different

800
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,140
shot of the turbo generator
hallway looking in the unit

801
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,570
1 2 direction.

802
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:33,380
More detritus, oh here's
a slightly better close

803
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,672
up of those components.

804
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,520
One of the interesting things
I found out about the facility

805
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,480
is way that access
is controlled.

806
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,110
So instead of having an RFID
card or something like that,

807
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,940
they've got cameras
and operators.

808
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:53,360
So what you see
here is a camera.

809
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,500
So Stanislaus would scan a badge
that would automatically call

810
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,020
someone who is an operator.

811
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,270
Stanislaus would say,
hey, I'm at this door.

812
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,938
I want to go into this location.

813
00:40:04,938 --> 00:40:05,730
Will you let me in?

814
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,355
And then they would
look at the camera,

815
00:40:07,355 --> 00:40:09,500
determine that yes,
that is Stanislaus.

816
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,545
He does want to
go into this area.

817
00:40:11,545 --> 00:40:13,670
And then they would approve
it and let him through.

818
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,800
Walking through the
corridors of the sarcophagus.

819
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,960
You can actually see up
here those lead sheets

820
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,032
I was talking about.

821
00:40:24,032 --> 00:40:25,740
I don't know how thick
they are on there,

822
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,110
or how close they are to
falling off, for that matter.

823
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:31,170
But I'm sure several
thousand pounds of lead

824
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:33,840
is right there alone.

825
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,440
These are main circulating
pumps, about one-half

826
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,080
of the main circulating
pumps for reactor 2.

827
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,700
And each one of
these things takes

828
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,970
something around, something
around 40 megawatts

829
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:50,790
to actually operate.

830
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:54,420
These are aligned
differently and are

831
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,870
of a different type than
the ones used in reactor 4

832
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:01,440
because reactors 1 and 2
were of an earlier design.

833
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,930
Ironically enough,
reactors 1 and 2 actually

834
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,700
don't have all of
the safety measures

835
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:10,050
that reactor 4 does, which is
a bit terrifying to think of.

836
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:18,260
Yet more photos, right, as I
said, dog problem at Chernobyl.

837
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,960
This is right outside the
entrance to a clean facility.

838
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,910
And occasionally these
dogs would wander in.

839
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:27,500
Unfortunately dogs are large
furry piles of easily airborne

840
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,800
contamination.

841
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,710
So they would walk in.

842
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,210
People would go
to shoo them out.

843
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:33,980
They would shake their
coats or whatever.

844
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,440
And then clean up
on aisle three,

845
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:41,300
because now there's
contamination everywhere.

846
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,330
More sad looking puppies.

847
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:47,750
New Safe Confinement, yet again,
to give you an idea of scale,

848
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,355
let's play find the workers.

849
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,400
Those are workers right there.

850
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,720
Can you guys see them?

851
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,980
AUDIENCE: Barely.

852
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:17,810
JAKE HECLA: Yeah, they're
really, really small

853
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:20,324
next to this facility.

854
00:42:20,324 --> 00:42:22,280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

855
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:27,170
JAKE HECLA: Yeah, I think I've
got a slightly better shot

856
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:27,670
here.

857
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:33,970
That's a guy right there.

858
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:37,550
There's also another
dude right here.

859
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:40,300
Yeah, this place is,
or this structure

860
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,343
is absolutely enormous.

861
00:42:41,343 --> 00:42:42,760
It's really hard
to wrap your head

862
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,430
around exactly how large it is.

863
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:49,117
So this is in an area
called the local zone.

864
00:42:49,117 --> 00:42:50,950
So it's the immediate
several hundred meters

865
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,870
surrounding the reactor.

866
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,612
As you can see, the
hazmat equipment

867
00:42:54,612 --> 00:42:56,320
that we're wearing
there is significantly

868
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,700
different from what we would
wear inside the reactor

869
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,880
or inside the
sarcophagus, mostly

870
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,940
because the threat from dust
in this area is pretty huge.

871
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,190
As you can see, we're
walking on fill.

872
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:11,110
It's actually meters
and meters of fill

873
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,820
because the ground
was so contaminated

874
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:15,970
that they scraped it
away, put fill in there,

875
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:19,120
put fill on top of that because
just the residual contamination

876
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,180
was enough to make it hazardous
to use as a work site.

877
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,820
Though they're not
shown in this image,

878
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:29,105
or I believe any
images here, there

879
00:43:29,105 --> 00:43:31,480
are little concrete
and lead structures

880
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,270
that these workers
take breaks behind

881
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:38,500
because you have a dose
limit that is enforced

882
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,910
while you're working there.

883
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:41,620
And if you're going
to take a smoke

884
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:44,110
break, as a huge fraction
of the population of Ukraine

885
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:49,522
smokes, or you're going to
take a break of another sort,

886
00:43:49,522 --> 00:43:51,730
they don't want you racking
up dose during that time.

887
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:54,400
So you basically hide in
a little concrete shack

888
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,200
for a while with a
few inches of lead

889
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,140
between you and the reactor.

890
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:03,940
Yet another shot
inside the sarcophagus,

891
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:06,710
Ed explaining something
about which I'm not sure.

892
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,040
As you can see these
places are not exactly

893
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,930
in the best condition
on the inside.

894
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:16,820
And one thing that
did concern me a lot

895
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,400
was the amount of dust
that was very, very

896
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,920
easy to kick up in the area.

897
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,290
This is inside control
room of reactor 4.

898
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:29,260
Selfie, which I didn't
mean to have in this album.

899
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:37,060
Control room 4 hasn't changed
a whole lot since last year.

900
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:40,150
But there is a
dividing wall that

901
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:42,520
actually separates
reactors 3 and 4 that's

902
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,780
being put together.

903
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:47,190
And it cuts right through the
edge of the fourth control

904
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:47,690
room.

905
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:50,685
And for a while, we actually
didn't know whether or not

906
00:44:50,685 --> 00:44:52,810
we were going to be able
to visit it at all because

907
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:53,920
of ongoing construction.

908
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,640
I'm very glad that
we were able to.

909
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,280
Most of the instruments
have been removed.

910
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,590
It's unclear as to why.

911
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:05,350
We've been told that some of it
was because of contamination.

912
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:09,160
But the pattern doesn't
really make sense.

913
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:15,320
This is the reactor control
room cartogram, excuse me,

914
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,480
reactor core cartogram,
which, as I said

915
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:21,020
was lit and could display
various parameters regarding

916
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:24,420
the various fuel channels.

917
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:30,080
There is only two control
rod indicator, well, yeah.

918
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:34,870
There are really only these
control rod indicators left.

919
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:36,620
And we believe that
actually some of these

920
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:37,580
might not be original.

921
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,163
Someone might have
stolen the real one

922
00:45:39,163 --> 00:45:42,493
and put another one back.

923
00:45:42,493 --> 00:45:44,160
I don't have any
evidence to support it.

924
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,980
But I suspect that there's
significant looting that

925
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:46,647
happens in here.

926
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:54,370
This is a rather
entertaining photo.

927
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:57,760
That means smoking area.

928
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,048
That's in the control room.

929
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:00,090
You shouldn't be smoking.

930
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,290
You shouldn't take your
mask off for any reason.

931
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:11,010
That's a high gamma
radiation warning sign.

932
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:13,140
It was in fact, not that
high of a dose rate,

933
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,880
somewhere in the range
of 30 mR an hour.

934
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:24,930
We also explored a little bit
outside of the more formal part

935
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:28,530
of the reactor
premises, namely we

936
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:31,410
went to this place called
Buriakivka 2, which

937
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:37,020
is a burial facility for
waste from the reactor,

938
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:40,590
not waste as in nuclear waste
but waste is in chunks of metal

939
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,900
and other things that are
contaminated and therefore

940
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,900
removed when the New Safe
Confinement Arch was being

941
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,950
built, or when, let's say, they
were building the separation

942
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:52,232
wall between reactors 3 and 4.

943
00:46:52,232 --> 00:46:53,940
And there were some
incredibly hot spots.

944
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:58,950
So I might, I think I have
some more photos later.

945
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:02,340
But just under that
little triangle,

946
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:08,850
the dose rate was 150 mR an
hour, so 0.15 rem an hour.

947
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:10,420
It's extremely high.

948
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:16,830
And that was just in a field
basically, not controlled, not

949
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:19,180
patrolled, no warning signs.

950
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,570
Getting dressed up, lots of fun.

951
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:29,547
That was the truck we were
sent to decontaminate.

952
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:31,380
Honestly it wasn't
particularly contaminated

953
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,172
in the first place.

954
00:47:32,172 --> 00:47:35,870
They weren't going to give us
real fun things to play with.

955
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:36,790
That's all of us.

956
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:39,100
And then as you notice,
the real workers

957
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:42,580
here are not wearing even
a fraction of what we are.

958
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:56,450
More decontamination,
yeah, see, barely anything.

959
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:58,950
These are chunks of metal that
have come out of the reactor.

960
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:03,270
We're not exactly sure what
part, what parts they are.

961
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:06,300
No one was really able to
answer our questions about them.

962
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,430
But they were also
rather contaminated,

963
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:10,740
somewhere in the
range of 50 to 75 mR

964
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:15,160
an hour on contact
in some spots.

965
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,952
More photos of Chernobyl, or
of Chernobyl from Pripyat.

966
00:48:18,952 --> 00:48:21,160
MICHAEL SHORT: Dr. Jake, I
want to take a quick break

967
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,610
and ask folks if they
have any questions on what

968
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,584
the experience was
like [INAUDIBLE]..

969
00:48:31,823 --> 00:48:32,490
JAKE HECLA: Yes?

970
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:34,282
AUDIENCE: Did you suffer
any adverse health

971
00:48:34,282 --> 00:48:35,620
effects or anything?

972
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:39,880
JAKE HECLA: Only the cold I
picked up on the way back.

973
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,450
The total dose that I received
on this entire expedition,

974
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:47,840
minus the flights there and
back, was 0.6 millisieverts.

975
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:52,090
So effectively, nothing.

976
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:53,710
MICHAEL SHORT: [INAUDIBLE].

977
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:57,190
JAKE HECLA: Well, all of
the high radiation areas

978
00:48:57,190 --> 00:49:01,160
that we were in, we were
encouraged to walk quickly,

979
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,880
is basically what
it comes down to.

980
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,980
The time portion of time,
distance, and shielding

981
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:09,300
was emphasized.

982
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,010
Further questions?

983
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:12,112
Yeah.

984
00:49:12,112 --> 00:49:15,290
AUDIENCE: Are there [INAUDIBLE]
radiation area versus

985
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:16,232
[INAUDIBLE].

986
00:49:16,232 --> 00:49:17,940
Do they use the same
levels [INAUDIBLE]??

987
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:21,570
JAKE HECLA: No, radiological
control in Ukraine

988
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:25,950
is a totally different
game than it is in the US.

989
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:29,190
There are the same
types of controls

990
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:34,650
that exist in the US just
don't exist at that site.

991
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:38,850
For areas that are immediately
dangerous to your health,

992
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:41,250
you know, 10 rad
an hour, something

993
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:44,130
like that, from what I
understand that there

994
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:47,850
are locked doors that prevent
one from accessing those

995
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:48,930
accidentally.

996
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:51,250
And there are warning signs
in a variety of locations.

997
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:55,560
But I don't think that there
is a the same standardization

998
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:01,726
of 5 mR an hours is a radiation
area, et cetera, et cetera.

999
00:50:01,726 --> 00:50:02,226
Yeah.

1000
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:06,573
Further?

1001
00:50:06,573 --> 00:50:08,240
MICHAEL SHORT: And
are folks still going

1002
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,200
to be running these tours
pretty continuously?

1003
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:10,940
JAKE HECLA: No.

1004
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:14,240
You won't be able to see the
sarcophagus itself because it

1005
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,870
will be contained within the
New Safe Confinement Arch

1006
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:19,890
pretty much now.

1007
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:22,550
It's 75, right, let's see.

1008
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:24,470
Last I checked, the New
Safe Confinement Arch

1009
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:29,660
was 75 percent of the way
over the reactor itself.

1010
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:32,030
Regular tourist
visits to Pripyat

1011
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:34,850
will continue to happen.

1012
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:37,640
This program that I went on
is something very special.

1013
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:45,800
Carl, Ed, and Erik have done
this type of thing once before.

1014
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,910
That was the trip I
went on last year.

1015
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:53,417
And they intend on doing it
once a year as long as they can.

1016
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:55,250
But that's pretty much
your only opportunity

1017
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:57,440
to get that kind of
access to the reactor.

1018
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,550
It takes a lot of work.

1019
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,280
MICHAEL SHORT: Anyone else
have questions for Jake?

1020
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,520
It's rare to meet someone that's
actually gone to Chernobyl to

1021
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,040
[INAUDIBLE].

1022
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,090
Yeah?

1023
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:11,970
AUDIENCE: Do you
think it's haunted?

1024
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:14,500
JAKE HECLA: No.

1025
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,080
There's a rather haunting
location, though,

1026
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,480
the Khodemchuk Memorial.

1027
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,750
So when the accident happened
there was one guy who was--

1028
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:26,080
depending on how you look at
it, either lucky or unlucky--

1029
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,390
in that he wasn't killed
by radiation poisoning.

1030
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:32,770
He was killed by being
flattened in the explosion.

1031
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:35,650
And his remains are
within the reactor

1032
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:39,162
and within the sarcophagus,
never really recovered him.

1033
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:40,870
Better than dying of
radiation poisoning.

1034
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:44,800
But nonetheless, not
a fantastic way to go.

1035
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,220
The memorial that is
within the sarcophagus

1036
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:53,770
is pretty interesting to
visit, and rather somber.

1037
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:56,920
Makes you reflect a little
bit on the enormous human toll

1038
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,220
that the accident had.
