8
00:00:21,967 --> 00:00:22,800
PROFESSOR: OK, guys.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,428
Welcome back.

10
00:00:23,428 --> 00:00:25,470
As you can see, we're not
using the screen today.

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,845
This is going to be one of
those fill-the-board lectures.

12
00:00:27,845 --> 00:00:30,373
But I am going to work you
through every single step.

13
00:00:30,373 --> 00:00:32,040
We're going to go
through the Q equation

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,673
and derive its most
general form together,

15
00:00:34,673 --> 00:00:36,090
which, for the
rest of this class,

16
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,950
we'll be using
simplified or reduced

17
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,440
forms to explain
a lot of the ion

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,050
or electron-nuclear
interactions as well

19
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,902
as things like
neutron scattering

20
00:00:44,902 --> 00:00:46,110
and all sorts of other stuff.

21
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,280
We'll do one example.

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,610
For any of you that have
looked at neutrons slowing down

23
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,410
before, how much
energy can a neutron

24
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,072
lose when it hits something?

25
00:00:54,072 --> 00:00:56,280
We'll be answering that
question today in a generally

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,270
mathematical form.

27
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,320
And then a few
lectures later, we'll

28
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,320
be going over some of the
more intuitive aspects

29
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,130
to help explain
it for everybody.

30
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,060
So I'm going to show you the
same situation that we've

31
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,480
been describing sort
of intuitively so far,

32
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,910
but we're going to hit
it mathematically today.

33
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,410
Let's say there's
a small nucleus,

34
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:20,250
1, that's firing at a large
nucleus, 2, and afterwards,

35
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,870
a different small nucleus, 3,
and a different large nucleus,

36
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,940
4, come flying out.

37
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,340
And so we're going to keep
this as general as possible.

38
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,410
So let's say if we draw angles
from their original paths,

39
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,840
particle 3 went
off at angle theta

40
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,570
and particle 4 went
off at angle phi.

41
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,780
So hopefully those are
differentiable enough.

42
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,640
And if we were to write the
overall Q equation showing

43
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,560
the balance between
mass and energy here,

44
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,280
we would simply have
the mass 1 c squared

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,043
plus kinetic energy of 1.

46
00:01:58,043 --> 00:01:59,460
So in this case,
we're just saying

47
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,230
that the mass and
the kinetic energy

48
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,810
of all particles on the
left side and the right side

49
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,790
has to be conserved.

50
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:12,750
So let's add mass 2 c squared
plus T2 has to equal mass 3 c

51
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:21,570
squared plus T3 plus mass
4 c squared plus T4, where,

52
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,800
just for symbols,
M refers to a mass,

53
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,630
T refers to a kinetic energy.

54
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,790
And so this conservation of
total mass or total energy

55
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,860
has got to be conserved.

56
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,820
And we'll use it again.

57
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,220
Because, again, we can describe
the Q, or the energy consumed

58
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,180
or released by the reaction,
as either the change in masses

59
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,972
or the change in energies.

60
00:02:48,972 --> 00:02:50,555
So in this case, we
can write that Q--

61
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,870
let's just group all of
the c squareds together

62
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,910
for easier writing.

63
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:07,560
If we take the initial masses
minus the final masses,

64
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,870
then we get a picture of
how much mass was converted

65
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,910
to energy, therefore,
how much energy

66
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,190
is available for
the reaction, or Q,

67
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,000
to turn it into kinetic energy.

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,150
So in this case, we can
put the kinetic energy

69
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:23,480
of the final products minus
the kinetic energies--

70
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,770
I'm going to keep with 1--

71
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,770
of the initial products.

72
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,480
And so we'll use this
a little later on.

73
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,340
One simplification
that we'll make now

74
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,670
is we'll assume that if we're
firing particles at anything,

75
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,070
that anything
starts off at rest.

76
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:41,880
So we can start by
saying there's no T2.

77
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,940
That's just a simplification
that we'll make right now.

78
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,880
And so then the
question is, what

79
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,480
quantities of this situation
are we likely to know,

80
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,070
which ones are we
not likely to know,

81
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,470
and which ones are left
to relate together?

82
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,630
So let's just go
through one by one.

83
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,930
Would we typically know the mass
of the initial particle coming

84
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,012
in?

85
00:04:03,012 --> 00:04:05,220
We probably know what we're
shooting at stuff, right?

86
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,140
So we'd know M1.

87
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,960
What about T1, the
initial kinetic energy?

88
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,460
Sure.

89
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,100
Let's say we have a reactor
whose energy we know,

90
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,990
or an accelerator, or
something that we're

91
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,540
controlling the energy,
like in problem set one.

92
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,339
We'd probably know that.

93
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,130
We'd probably know what
things we're firing at.

94
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,510
And we would probably
know what the masses

95
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,880
of the final products are,
because you guys have been

96
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,780
doing nuclear reaction
analysis and calculating

97
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,990
binding energies and everything
for the last couple of weeks.

98
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:42,030
But we might not know
the kinetic energies

99
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:42,940
of what's coming out.

100
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,270
Let's say we didn't actually
even know the masses yet.

101
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,040
We'd have to figure out a way to
get both the kinetic energies.

102
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,210
And what about
these angles here?

103
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,730
This is the new variable
that we're introducing,

104
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,310
is the kinetic energy
of particles 3 and 4

105
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,160
is going to depend on what
angles they fire off at.

106
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,010
Let me give you a limiting case.

107
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:05,110
Let's say theta was 0.

108
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,550
What would that
mean, physically?

109
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,770
What would be happening
to particles 1, 2, 3,

110
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,220
and 4 if theta and phi were
0, if they kept on moving

111
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,293
in the exact same path?

112
00:05:19,293 --> 00:05:19,793
Yeah?

113
00:05:19,793 --> 00:05:22,150
AUDIENCE: Is it a fusion
event, or [INAUDIBLE]

114
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,192
PROFESSOR: We don't know.

115
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:23,950
Well, let's see.

116
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,450
Yeah.

117
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,490
If it was a fusion event-- let's
say there was one here and one

118
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,668
standing still--

119
00:05:28,668 --> 00:05:30,460
then the whole center
of mass of the system

120
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,627
would have to move that way.

121
00:05:31,627 --> 00:05:33,820
So one example could
be a fusion event.

122
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,800
A second example could
be absolutely nothing.

123
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,220
It's perfectly valid to say if,
let's say, particle 1 scatters

124
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,130
off particle 2 at an
angle of 0 degrees,

125
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:54,200
that's what's known as
forward scattering, which

126
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,120
is to say that theta equals 0.

127
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,190
So this is another quantity
that we might not know.

128
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,910
We might not know what
theta and phi are.

129
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,160
And the problem here is we've
got, like, three or four

130
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,980
unknowns and only one
equation to relate them.

131
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,990
So what other-- yeah?

132
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:11,515
Question?

133
00:06:11,515 --> 00:06:12,890
AUDIENCE: For
forward scattering,

134
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,280
when you say theta equals 0, do
you mean they just sort of move

135
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,260
together forward, kind of
like an inelastic collision,

136
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,260
and they just keep moving
in the same direction?

137
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,218
PROFESSOR: An inelastic
collision would be one.

138
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:26,240
And since we haven't gone
through what inelastic means,

139
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,300
that would mean some
sort of collision where--

140
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,020
let's see.

141
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,776
How would I explain this?

142
00:06:31,776 --> 00:06:34,040
I'd say an inelastic
collision would be like

143
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,300
if particles 1 and 2 were to
fuse, like a capture event,

144
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,570
for example, or a capture and
then a re-emission, let's say,

145
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,390
of a neutron.

146
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,890
Yeah.

147
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,660
If it was re-emitted in
the forward direction,

148
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,743
then that could be an
inelastic scattering event--

149
00:06:46,743 --> 00:06:47,490
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

150
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,365
PROFESSOR: --but still
in the same direction.

151
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:51,740
Or an elastic scatter
at an angle of theta

152
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,010
equals 0 could be like there
wasn't any scattering at all.

153
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,650
Because really in
the end, can matter--

154
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:01,100
let's say if you have a
neutron firing at a nucleus,

155
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,930
depends on what angle
it bounces off of,

156
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,240
in the billiard ball sense.

157
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,210
If it bounces off at an angle
of 0, that means it missed.

158
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,490
We would consider
that theta equals 0.

159
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,110
But the point here
is that we now

160
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,120
have more quantities
unknown than we

161
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,460
have equations to define them.

162
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,200
So how else can
we start relating

163
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,280
some of these quantities?

164
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,500
What else can we
conserve, since we've

165
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,420
already got mass and energy?

166
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,410
What's that third quantity
I always yell out?

167
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,210
AUDIENCE: Momentum.

168
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,140
PROFESSOR: Momentum.

169
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:28,750
Right.

170
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,980
So let's start writing some
of the momentum conservation

171
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,730
equations so we can try
and nail these things down.

172
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,860
So I'm going to write
each step one at a time.

173
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,510
We'll start by
conserving momentum.

174
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,680
That's what we'll do right here.

175
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,650
And we can write the x and
the y equations separately.

176
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,590
So what's the momentum
of particle 1?

177
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,590
How do we express that?

178
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,840
AUDIENCE: Mass times velocity.

179
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,480
PROFESSOR: Yep.

180
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,290
So it would be like M1 V1.

181
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:02,490
So we'll have a little box
right here for momentum.

182
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,920
We could say mass
times velocity--

183
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,290
or, how do we express that
in terms of the variables

184
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,540
that we have here,
like we did last week?

185
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,750
What about in terms
of kinetic energies?

186
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,620
Well, another way of
writing mass times velocity

187
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,610
would be root 2MT.

188
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:32,669
Because in this case, we
would have root 2 times

189
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:39,000
M1 times 1/2 M1 V1 squared.

190
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,100
The 2s here cancel.

191
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,175
Let's see.

192
00:08:42,175 --> 00:08:43,500
You have M1 squared.

193
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,120
You have a V squared.

194
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,370
And the square root of M
squared V squared is just MV.

195
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,330
So this is an equivalent
way of writing the momentum

196
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,543
in the variables that
we're working in already.

197
00:08:56,543 --> 00:08:58,710
And so since that doesn't
introduce another variable

198
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,540
like velocity--
which we do know,

199
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,790
but it's kind of confusing
to add more symbols-- let's

200
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,560
keep as few as possible.

201
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,900
So what's the x
momentum of particle 1?

202
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,510
Just what I've got up there.

203
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,360
2 M1 T1.

204
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,680
What's the x momentum in
this frame of particle 2?

205
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,440
0.

206
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,340
We're assuming
that it's at rest.

207
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,140
And now, what's the x
momentum of particle 3?

208
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:33,447
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

209
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,030
PROFESSOR: I heard
a couple of things.

210
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,080
Can you say them louder?

211
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,635
AUDIENCE: Square
root of 2 M3 T3?

212
00:09:38,635 --> 00:09:39,260
PROFESSOR: Yep.

213
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,340
Root 2 M3 T3.

214
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,560
But in this case,
if we're defining,

215
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,100
let's say, our
x-axis here, it also

216
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,820
matters what this angle is.

217
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:56,780
So you've got to multiply by
cosine theta in this case.

218
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,200
And that's the x
momentum of particle 3.

219
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,050
And we've also got to
account for particle 4.

220
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:10,410
So we'll say add 2 cosine phi.

221
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,170
Now let's do the same
thing for the y momentum.

222
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,990
What's the y momentum
of particles 1 and 2?

223
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,000
0.

224
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,220
They're not moving in
the y direction to start.

225
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,480
And how about particle 3?

226
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,760
I hear whispers, but
nothing vocalized.

227
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,495
AUDIENCE: Sine?

228
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:34,120
PROFESSOR: Yep.

229
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:42,190
Same thing, but root
2 M3 T3 sine theta.

230
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,310
And M4-- I almost
wrote the wrong sign

231
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,470
there-- has got to be a minus.

232
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,380
If the momentum of the initial
particle system in the y

233
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,550
direction is 0, so
must the final momentum

234
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,440
in the y direction.

235
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,300
So these two momenta have
to be equal and opposite.

236
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,600
And that's times sine phi.

237
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,690
So now we actually have sets
of equations that relate

238
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,970
all of our unknown quantities.

239
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,400
We have the mass
conservation equation,

240
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,150
we have the Q equation,
we have the x momentum,

241
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,780
and we have the y momentum.

242
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,970
And from this point on,
it's a matter of algebra

243
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,490
to express some of
these quantities

244
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,240
in terms of some of the others.

245
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,780
So let's get started with that.

246
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,150
Because angles
are kind of messy,

247
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,320
and theta should
uniquely define phi,

248
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,360
let's try and get things
in terms of just one angle.

249
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,900
So I'm going to
start by separating

250
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,740
the thetas and the phis on
either side of the equals sign,

251
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,470
so that hopefully later
on we can eliminate one

252
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,240
in a system of equations.

253
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,090
So all I'm going to do is
I'm going to subtract or add

254
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:56,060
the theta terms to the
other side of the equation.

255
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,585
So let's say we'll
separate angles.

256
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:14,850
So we'll have root 2 M1 T1
and minus root 2 M3 T3 cosine

257
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,930
theta.

258
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,335
I'll be depending on you
guys to check for sign errors

259
00:12:18,335 --> 00:12:19,710
here because those
will be messy.

260
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,450
I do have notes in
case, but I'm hoping

261
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,190
I won't have to look at them.

262
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,780
And all we have
left on this side

263
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:33,390
is root 2 M4 T4 cosine phi.

264
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,280
So that's the x
momentum equation.

265
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,970
Let's do the same thing with
the y momentum equation.

266
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,360
So all we'll do is
take the theta term

267
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,820
and stick it to the
left of the equals sign.

268
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:54,960
So that would give us minus
root 2 M3 T3 sine theta equals

269
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:02,540
minus root 2 M4 T4 sine phi.

270
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:06,020
Right away, we can see that
the minus signs can cancel out,

271
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,120
just for simplicity.

272
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,810
And what else is common to
these that we can get rid of?

273
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,310
Yep?

274
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,435
AUDIENCE: Square root of 2.

275
00:13:14,435 --> 00:13:17,410
PROFESSOR: Everything here
has a square root of 2.

276
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,140
So we'll just get rid of
all of the square root of 2s

277
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,920
to simplify as much as possible.

278
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,060
And now we look a little stuck.

279
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,930
But now is the time to remember
those trigonometric identities

280
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,680
back from high school
that I don't think--

281
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,310
has anyone used these since?

282
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,820
In 1801 or 1802, anyone
used a trig identity?

283
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,620
A little bit?

284
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,590
OK.

285
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,390
I would hope so.

286
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,798
But I don't know what other
people are teaching nowadays.

287
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:46,340
At least this way I'll make sure
you remember the high school

288
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,390
stuff.

289
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,020
We're going to rely on
the fact that we already

290
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,070
have got a cosine and a sine.

291
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,260
We have a set of
simultaneous equations.

292
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,440
If we can add them together
and destroy the angles somehow,

293
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,640
that will make
things a lot easier.

294
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,420
So for the thetas, we
have a cosine, a sine,

295
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,930
and an unangled term
that looks kind of messy.

296
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,500
Here we have a
cosine and a sine.

297
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,030
Anyone have any
idea where we could

298
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,875
go next to destroy
one of these angles?

299
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,110
Anyone remember any handy
cosine or sine trig identities?

300
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,610
AUDIENCE: If you
squared both terms,

301
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,010
you could get square root of
cosine squared, square root

302
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:23,510
of-- sorry.

303
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,800
You get cosine squared
and sine squared

304
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,050
and then you factor out
the square root of M4T4

305
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,618
and then cosine squared
plus sine squared equals 1.

306
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,410
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

307
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,270
So we can rely on
the fact that if we

308
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:36,860
can square both sides of both
equations and add them up,

309
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,310
we would have a
cosine squared of phi

310
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:46,930
plus a sine squared of
phi, which also equals 1.

311
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:51,180
So we can destroy this phi angle
and make things a lot simpler.

312
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,150
So we'll start by
squaring both sides.

313
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,020
Let's start with the
x momentum equation.

314
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,170
So if we have--

315
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,520
let's see-- root M1T1.

316
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,000
So we're going to take
that stuff squared.

317
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,490
And that squared
is not too hard.

318
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,350
Neither are those.

319
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,360
So we'll have root M1 T1
squared, which just gives us

320
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:31,690
M1 T1, minus root M1 T1 times
root M3 T3 cosine theta.

321
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:38,470
Let's just lump those terms
together as root M1 M3 T1 T3

322
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,170
cosine theta.

323
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,670
Also, anyone, raise
your hand or let

324
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,180
me know if I'm going too fast.

325
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,060
I'm trying to hit
every single step.

326
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,550
But in case I skip one,
please slow me down.

327
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,940
That's what class is for.

328
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,080
OK.

329
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,740
And then we've got another one.

330
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,480
Let's just stick a
2 in front of there

331
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,470
and plus that term squared.

332
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:06,120
So we'll have M3 T3.

333
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:09,670
Let's see.

334
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,590
Yeah.

335
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:17,960
Looks like cosine
squared of theta.

336
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,010
Yep.

337
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,990
Equals-- this one's easier--

338
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:29,740
M4 T4 cosine squared of phi.

339
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,110
OK.

340
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,200
Now we'll do the same thing
for the y momentum equation.

341
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,405
Much easier because there's
no addition anywhere.

342
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:43,796
And we have M3 sine
squared theta--

343
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:51,880
over here-- equals M4
T4 sine squared phi.

344
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,060
So this is quite nice.

345
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,040
Now if we add these
equations together,

346
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,820
we get rid of all of the
cosine and sine squared terms.

347
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,310
So let's add them up.

348
00:17:03,572 --> 00:17:05,510
Let's see.

349
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,950
We'll add the two equations.

350
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,762
Add equations.

351
00:17:15,762 --> 00:17:17,720
And let's try and group
all the terms together.

352
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:29,215
So we have M1 T1
minus 2 root M1 M3--

353
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,270
it's getting hard to write
over the lip of the chalkboard

354
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:32,770
here--

355
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,200
cosine theta.

356
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:47,910
And we have M3 T3 cosine
squared theta plus M3 T3

357
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:48,860
sine squared theta.

358
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:06,340
Equals M4 T4 cosine squared
theta plus sine squared theta--

359
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:06,960
or phi.

360
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,460
I'm sorry.

361
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,810
Cosine squared phi
plus sine squared phi.

362
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:13,310
OK.

363
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,250
Hopefully that's as low
as I'll have to write.

364
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,350
And like we saw
before, cosine squared

365
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,150
plus sine squared equals 1.

366
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:24,150
So that goes away.

367
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,820
That goes away.

368
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,440
And let's keep going over
on this side of the board.

369
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,290
I told you this would
be a fill-the-board day.

370
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,790
Let's see if we
actually get all six

371
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,170
instead of just
the four visible.

372
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:38,190
But I think we'll finish this
derivation in four boards.

373
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,130
So let's write what
we've got left.

374
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,030
Let's see.

375
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:41,720
Remaining.

376
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:53,730
So we have M1 T1
minus 2 root M1 M3--

377
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,680
so much easier to
write standing up--

378
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:05,070
cosine theta equals M4 T4.

379
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,210
Quite a bit simpler.

380
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,192
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

381
00:19:07,192 --> 00:19:08,400
PROFESSOR: Did I miss a term?

382
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,092
AUDIENCE: The M3 T3.

383
00:19:09,092 --> 00:19:09,720
PROFESSOR: Ah.

384
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,150
Thank you.

385
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:10,500
You're right.

386
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,042
You're right.

387
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:17,650
And we had a plus M3 T3.

388
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,900
Yeah, that would be important.

389
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,090
Thank you.

390
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:23,570
Equals M4 T4.

391
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,900
So we now have a relation
between the masses,

392
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,410
the energies, and one angle,
which is getting a lot better.

393
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:35,210
We still have one more
variable than we can deal with.

394
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,830
So let's say if we're--

395
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,568
let's see.

396
00:19:38,568 --> 00:19:40,110
Which of these
variables do you think

397
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,027
we can eliminate using any
of the equations you see,

398
00:19:43,027 --> 00:19:44,860
let's go with, on that
top board over there?

399
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,610
Well, what other
quantities are we

400
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:59,195
likely to know about
this nuclear reaction?

401
00:19:59,195 --> 00:20:00,320
Let's bring this back down.

402
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,618
Are we likely to
know the Q value?

403
00:20:05,618 --> 00:20:06,470
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

404
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,138
PROFESSOR: Probably.

405
00:20:08,138 --> 00:20:09,680
Because like you
guys have been doing

406
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,380
on problem sets one and
two, if you know, let's say,

407
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,500
the binding energies, or the
masses, or the excess masses,

408
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,320
or the kinetic energies
of all your products,

409
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,540
any combination of
those can get you

410
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,150
the Q value of that reaction.

411
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,840
And if you just look up those
reactions like, let's say,

412
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,660
radioactive decay reactions,
on the table of nuclides,

413
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,370
it just gives you the Q value.

414
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:34,240
So chances are we can express
some of these kinetic energies

415
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,230
in terms of Q.

416
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,680
And all we've got left
is T1, T3, and T4.

417
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,530
So which of these are
we most likely to be

418
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,720
able to know or measure?

419
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,530
T1, we probably fixed it
by cranking up our particle

420
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:52,280
accelerator to a certain energy.

421
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,590
T3 or T4, what do
you guys think?

422
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,450
Let's say we had a
very small nucleus

423
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,520
firing at a very big one.

424
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,020
Which one do you
think would be more

425
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,850
likely to escape
this system and get

426
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:06,934
detected by us standing a couple
feet away with a detector?

427
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:07,900
Yep?

428
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,890
AUDIENCE: T3.

429
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,320
PROFESSOR: Probably T3,
the smaller particle.

430
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,570
We've just arbitrarily
chosen that.

431
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,250
But for intuitive
sake, let's say, yeah.

432
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:21,100
Why don't we try and get
T4 in terms of Q T1 and T3?

433
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,300
That's not too hard,
since it's addition.

434
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,040
So our next step
will be substitute.

435
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,450
And we'll say that Q equals--

436
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:38,070
I'm just going to copy
it up from there--

437
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:43,052
T3 plus T4 minus T1.

438
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:54,280
So we can isolate T4 and say
T4 equals Q plus T1 minus T3.

439
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,190
And continue substituting.

440
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,800
I usually don't like to have
my back to the class this much.

441
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,860
But when you're writing this
much, it can be a little hard.

442
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,310
So let's stick this T4 in right
here and rewrite the equation

443
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,270
as we've got it.

444
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:31,350
M1 T1 minus 2 root M1 M3 T1 T3
cosine theta plus M3 T3 equals

445
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:37,050
M4 times Q plus T1 minus T3.

446
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:41,080
I anticipate us needing to see
this side of the board soon.

447
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,020
I also apologize for
the amount of time

448
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,410
it takes to write these things.

449
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,110
There's another
strategy one can use

450
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,960
at the board which is
defining intermediate symbols.

451
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,970
And here's why I'm
not doing that.

452
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,245
When I was a freshman, back in--

453
00:22:53,245 --> 00:22:55,650
whoa-- 2001.

454
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,150
Who here was born after 2001?

455
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:58,650
Nobody.

456
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,150
OK.

457
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,450
Thank god.

458
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,750
I don't feel so old.

459
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,000
I was in 18023, which was
math with applications,

460
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,940
which was better known as
math with extra theory.

461
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,920
And in one class, not only
did we fill nine boards,

462
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,250
but we ran out of
English letters--

463
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,040
symbols-- and we ran out
of Greek letter symbols,

464
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,020
and we moved on to Hebrew.

465
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,420
Because they were distinct
enough from English and Greek.

466
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,200
And being, I think, the only
Hebrew speaker in the class,

467
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,242
I was the only one that
could follow the symbols,

468
00:23:26,242 --> 00:23:27,990
but I couldn't follow
the math anymore.

469
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,780
So I am not going to define
intermediate symbols for this

470
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,970
and just keep it
understandable, even

471
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:36,050
if it takes longer to write.

472
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,140
OK.

473
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,110
So let's start off
by dividing by M4.

474
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,200
Our goal now is to
try to isolate Q.

475
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,900
Because this is something
that we would know or measure.

476
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,690
And it will relate all of the
other quantities, only one

477
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:55,150
of which we won't
really know yet.

478
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,490
So let's divide
everything by M4.

479
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:07,900
So we have T1 times M1 over
M4 minus 2 over M4 times root

480
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:20,250
of all that stuff plus
T3 times M3 over M4

481
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:24,970
equals Q plus T1 minus T3.

482
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,870
And we've almost isolated
Q. I'll call this step just

483
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,990
add and subtract.

484
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,740
And I'm going to group
the terms together.

485
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,650
So let's, for example,
group all the T1s together

486
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,610
and group all the T3s together.

487
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:46,240
So if I subtract T1, I get
T1 times M1 over M4 minus 1,

488
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:57,550
minus 2 over M4 root M1 M3
T1 T3 cosine theta, plus--

489
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:09,140
and if I add T3, then I would
get M3 over M4 plus 1 equals Q.

490
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,710
So this is a good place to stop,
turn around, and see you guys,

491
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,230
and now ask you, which of
the remaining quantities

492
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,880
do we probably not know?

493
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,628
So let's just go
through them one by one,

494
00:25:21,628 --> 00:25:22,670
just to remind ourselves.

495
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,960
Are we likely to
know what T1 is?

496
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,380
Probably.

497
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,075
How about the masses M1 and M4?

498
00:25:31,075 --> 00:25:32,700
If we know what
particles are reacting,

499
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,660
we can just look those up,
or measure them, or whatever.

500
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,600
We know M4.

501
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,650
We know our masses.

502
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:39,240
We know T1.

503
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:39,850
What about T3?

504
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,510
We don't necessarily know yet.

505
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,550
So T3 is a question mark.

506
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,710
How about cosine theta or theta?

507
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:55,170
We haven't said yet.

508
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,760
And T3 we don't know.

509
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,930
And the masses we know.

510
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,940
And the Q we know.

511
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,410
So finally, to solve for--

512
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:06,280
well, we only have two
variables left, T3 and theta.

513
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,830
So this here-- this is actually
called the Q equation in its

514
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,060
most complete form--

515
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,780
describes the relationship
between the kinetic energy

516
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:23,650
of the outgoing particle and
the angle at which it comes off.

517
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:24,710
How do we solve this?

518
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,377
How do we get one in
terms of the other?

519
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,820
Anyone recognize what kind
of equation we have here?

520
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,320
It's a little obscure.

521
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,290
Well, it's not obscure.

522
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,538
But it's a little bit hiding.

523
00:26:40,538 --> 00:26:42,080
But it should be a
very familiar one.

524
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,890
Think back to high school again.

525
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:44,390
Yes.

526
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:50,990
AUDIENCE: Is it the cosine angle
for the triangle [INAUDIBLE]

527
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,580
PROFESSOR: Let's see.

528
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,160
Certainly, there's probably
some trig involved in here,

529
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,050
in terms of, yeah, if
you know the cosine,

530
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,240
then you know, let's
say, the x or the y

531
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,710
component of the momentum.

532
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,630
But there's something
simpler, something that

533
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,838
doesn't require trigonometry.

534
00:27:05,838 --> 00:27:06,338
Yep.

535
00:27:06,338 --> 00:27:07,450
AUDIENCE: Is it quadratic?

536
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,158
PROFESSOR: It is.

537
00:27:08,158 --> 00:27:10,090
It's a quadratic--
so who saw that?

538
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:15,110
It's actually a quadratic
equation, where the variable

539
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:18,960
is the square root of T3.

540
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,040
That's the trick here, is you
have something without T3,

541
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,267
you have something
with square root T3,

542
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:26,850
and you have something
with T3, better

543
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:31,000
known as root T3 squared.

544
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,830
And there.

545
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,760
So this is actually
a quadratic equation.

546
00:27:41,098 --> 00:27:42,640
Despite the fact
that it may not have

547
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,210
looked that way in the
first place, there we go.

548
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,210
So now, someone who
remembers from high school,

549
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:54,890
tell me, what are the roots
of a quadratic equation?

550
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:59,170
Let's say if we have the form
y equals ax squared plus bx

551
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:03,842
plus c, what does x equal?

552
00:28:03,842 --> 00:28:04,550
Just call it out.

553
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,960
AUDIENCE: Negative b--

554
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,962
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

555
00:28:06,962 --> 00:28:09,330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
square root--

556
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,040
PROFESSOR: Yep.

557
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,292
AUDIENCE: --b
squared minus 4ac--

558
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:14,000
PROFESSOR: Over--

559
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,840
AUDIENCE: 2a.

560
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,040
PROFESSOR: 2a.

561
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:21,170
And in this case,
a is that stuff.

562
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:24,500
b is that stuff without the T3.

563
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,600
And c is that stuff.

564
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,833
Because we have,
like, 15 minutes

565
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,500
before I want to open
it up to questions

566
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,380
and I don't think we have to
repeat the quadratic formula

567
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,020
stuff, I will skip ahead.

568
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,160
Skip ahead.

569
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,760
This is when I'd normally say
it's an exercise to the reader.

570
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,443
But no.

571
00:28:43,443 --> 00:28:44,860
It's not the phrase
I like to use.

572
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,670
It's boring.

573
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:49,420
And I can just tell you
guys what it ends up as.

574
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:53,890
It ends up with root T3 equals--
and this is the one time I am

575
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,470
going to define new symbols
because it's just easier

576
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,000
to parse--

577
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,130
ends up being, we'll call
it s, plus or minus root

578
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:08,500
s squared plus t, where s--

579
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,720
let's see if I can remember
this without looking it up.

580
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,220
No.

581
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,270
I have to look at my notes.

582
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:17,380
I don't want to get it wrong
and have you all write it down

583
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,300
incorrectly because of me.

584
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,730
There we go.

585
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:26,660
The remaining stuff
in the square root, E1

586
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:31,520
cosine theta over M3 plus M4.

587
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,850
And t equals M4 Q--

588
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,030
is it a minus?

589
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:38,645
It is a plus.

590
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:49,290
Over M3 plus M4.

591
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,660
So these are the roots
of this equation.

592
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,970
This is how you
can actually relate

593
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,800
the kinetic energy of
the outgoing particle

594
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,520
directly to the angle.

595
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,620
So I want to let that
sink in just for a minute,

596
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,330
stop here, and check
to see if there's

597
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,580
any questions on the
derivation before we

598
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,340
start to use it to do something
a little more concrete.

599
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,041
Yep.

600
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,885
AUDIENCE: Where did
the E come from?

601
00:30:10,885 --> 00:30:12,240
PROFESSOR: The E. Oh, I'm sorry.

602
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,760
That's a T. Thank you.

603
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,810
Kinetic energy.

604
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,790
Again, we should be
consistent with symbols.

605
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,740
And I think--

606
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,670
I don't see any
other hanging Es.

607
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,170
Good.

608
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:24,043
Thank you.

609
00:30:24,043 --> 00:30:26,460
So any other questions on the
derivation as we've done it?

610
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,430
We managed to do it in
less than four boards.

611
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:31,190
There we go.

612
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:31,690
OK.

613
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,820
Since I don't see
any questions, let's

614
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,820
get into a couple of the
implications of this.

615
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:44,410
So let's now look at what
defines an exothermic reaction

616
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:47,620
where we say if Q
is greater than 0--

617
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:52,510
which is to say that some of the
mass becomes kinetic energy--

618
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:56,770
if an exothermic reaction is
energetically possible, then

619
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:59,600
what is the minimum T1?

620
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,400
Ah.

621
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,540
That's why I brought it.

622
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,510
What's the minimum T1 up here
to make that exothermic reaction

623
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,010
happen?

624
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,430
We'll put a condition on T1.

625
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,260
So if the reaction's
exothermic, which

626
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,790
means it will happen
spontaneously,

627
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:22,063
how much extra kinetic energy do
you have to give to the system

628
00:31:22,063 --> 00:31:23,230
to make the reaction happen?

629
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,030
Let's think of it in
the chemical sense.

630
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:35,150
If you have an exothermic
chemical reaction,

631
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,220
is it spontaneous or is it not?

632
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,480
It is spontaneous.

633
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,340
Same thing in the nuclear world.

634
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,310
If you have an exothermic
nuclear reaction,

635
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,530
do you need any kinetic
energy to start with

636
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,340
to make it happen?

637
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:48,840
No.

638
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,080
OK.

639
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,630
There we go.

640
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,240
So that's kind of the analogy.

641
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,870
So T1 has to be greater
than or equal to 0.

642
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,660
It's pretty much not
a condition, right?

643
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,650
It happens all the time.

644
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:03,420
So if we were to say
T1 were to equal 0--

645
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:07,410
let me get my crossing
out color again.

646
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:10,950
If T1 were to equal 0,
then s could equals 0.

647
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:17,000
And T1 is 0 here.

648
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,635
And then you just get--

649
00:32:18,635 --> 00:32:27,530
that's an s-- t equals
M4 Q over M3 plus M4.

650
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,660
And this just kind of
gives you a relation

651
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,800
between the relative kinetic
energies of the two particles.

652
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,900
Another way of
writing this relation

653
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:43,120
would just be that
E3 plus E4 has to be

654
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,530
greater than or equal to E1.

655
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:47,030
AUDIENCE: T?

656
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,113
PROFESSOR: All this-- hmm?

657
00:32:48,113 --> 00:32:48,854
AUDIENCE: T?

658
00:32:48,854 --> 00:32:49,710
PROFESSOR: Ah.

659
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,210
Thank you.

660
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:55,830
Because Es will be used in a
different point of this class.

661
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,060
So we'll stick with
T for kinetic energy.

662
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,560
Thank you.

663
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,140
So all that this
condition says is

664
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:05,362
that if mass has been
converted to energy,

665
00:33:05,362 --> 00:33:06,820
then that kinetic
energy at the end

666
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,940
has to be greater
than at the beginning.

667
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,917
And that's all it is.

668
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:12,750
So it makes this equation
quite a lot easier

669
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,810
to solve for an
exothermic reaction.

670
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:18,240
You can also start to look
to say, well, what happens

671
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,510
as we vary this angle theta?

672
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,980
What does the kinetic energy do?

673
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,362
Let's take the case of
an endothermic reaction.

674
00:33:29,362 --> 00:33:30,695
Now we are running out of space.

675
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:42,120
For an endothermic reaction
where Q is less than 0,

676
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,160
you would have to have
T1 to be greater than 0.

677
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,470
Otherwise the
reaction can't occur.

678
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,500
So you have to impart additional
energy into the system

679
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,910
to get it going.

680
00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:01,218
And it also means that not every
angle of emission is possible.

681
00:34:01,218 --> 00:34:03,260
You might wonder, why do
we care about the angle,

682
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,010
because the reaction
still happens anyway?

683
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:07,130
Well, it doesn't
happen at every angle.

684
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,320
And reactions have
different probabilities

685
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,920
of occurring depending on the
angle at which the things come

686
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,320
out.

687
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,980
So you could see here
that as you vary T1

688
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,780
and as you vary cosine
theta, you still

689
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,840
have to make sure that this
quantity on the inside here--

690
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,690
so, s squared plus t--

691
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:33,100
always has to be greater
than or equal to zero or else

692
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,370
the roots of this are imaginary
and you don't have a solution.

693
00:34:40,017 --> 00:34:42,100
So it's kind of nice that
this came out quadratic.

694
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,725
Because it lets you take some of
the knowledge you already know

695
00:34:44,725 --> 00:34:48,100
and now apply it to say, when or
when are nuclear reactions not

696
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:48,949
or are they allowed?

697
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:49,449
Wait.

698
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:50,679
Let me rephrase that.

699
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:53,560
When are nuclear reactions
allowed or not allowed?

700
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,760
You can now tell, depending
on the angle of emission

701
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,640
and the incoming energy and the
masses, which are all things

702
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,546
that you would tend to know.

703
00:35:03,546 --> 00:35:05,810
So is everyone clear on
the implications here?

704
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:09,190
If not, let me know.

705
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,714
Because that's what
this class is for.

706
00:35:10,714 --> 00:35:11,158
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

707
00:35:11,158 --> 00:35:12,741
Can you just go over
it one more time?

708
00:35:12,741 --> 00:35:13,600
PROFESSOR: Yes.

709
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,560
So, for exothermic reactions
where Q is greater than 0,

710
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,590
all that says from our initial
part of the Q equation,

711
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:24,010
if Q is greater than 0, then
we have this thing right here,

712
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:27,190
where the final kinetic
energies have to be larger

713
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,690
than the initial one.

714
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,940
Which is to say that
some mass has turned

715
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:33,350
into extra kinetic energy.

716
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:36,260
And the solution to
these is pretty easy

717
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,170
because you don't need
any kinetic energy to make

718
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,330
an exothermic reaction happen.

719
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:45,530
So you can just set T1 equal
to 0, which makes s equal to 0,

720
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:48,300
because they're all
multiplied here.

721
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,750
And then it
simplifies lowercase t

722
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:55,110
as just a ratio of those
masses times the Q equation,

723
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:58,590
which will tell you pretty
much how much kinetic energy is

724
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:04,480
going to be sent off to
particle 3 right here.

725
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,200
Up there.

726
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,310
Particle 3.

727
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:12,560
Because then we have this
condition, if root T3 equals s

728
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,610
plus square root of
s squared plus t,

729
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:21,550
and we've decided
that s equals 0,

730
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:30,420
that just means that T3 equals
lowercase t, which equals that.

731
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,170
So then you've uniquely
defined the kinetic energy

732
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:36,550
for an exothermic
reaction, as long

733
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:39,010
as you have no incoming
kinetic energy.

734
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:42,260
For the case of an endothermic
reaction, first of all,

735
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,170
we know that the
incoming kinetic energy

736
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,750
has to be greater than 0.

737
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,370
It's like the excess
energy that you

738
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,430
need to get a chemical
reaction going.

739
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,330
Has anyone here
ever played with--

740
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:55,715
what's the one, a
striking one here?

741
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:57,340
Well, has anyone ever
lit anything on--

742
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,080
no, that's-- yeah.

743
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,890
Of course you have.

744
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:02,164
And that's not a
good explanation.

745
00:37:02,164 --> 00:37:03,120
Hmm.

746
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,552
What's a good, striking
endothermic chemical reaction?

747
00:37:07,552 --> 00:37:09,090
Can anyone think of one?

748
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:09,590
Yeah?

749
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:12,410
AUDIENCE: When you put tin
foil in Liquid-Plumr and it

750
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:12,910
releases--

751
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:15,207
PROFESSOR: And it's
a hydrogen generator?

752
00:37:15,207 --> 00:37:16,040
AUDIENCE: Let's see.

753
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,060
I guess that's an explosion.

754
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,080
PROFESSOR: I think
that happen-- yeah.

755
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,330
That's more like an explosion.

756
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:22,540
That's, like, the intuitive
definition of exothermic.

757
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,040
Yeah.

758
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,730
Actually, there's a fun
one you can do, too.

759
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:26,120
This is great that
it's on video.

760
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,990
You do that plus put manganese
dioxide in hydrogen peroxide

761
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,090
and you have an
oxygen generator.

762
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:35,178
And then you have the purest,
beyond glacially pure,

763
00:37:35,178 --> 00:37:35,720
spring water.

764
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,850
You just mix H and O directly.

765
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,020
Just don't get near it.

766
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,390
Because it tends
to be pretty loud.

767
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:44,150
We do this for our RTC
or reactor technology

768
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:48,063
course, where I've got to
teach a bunch of CEOs enough

769
00:37:48,063 --> 00:37:50,480
basic high school chemistry
so they can understand reactor

770
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,630
water chemistry.

771
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,140
And the way I make sure that
they're paying attention

772
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,530
is with a tremendous explosion.

773
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:00,550
So folks come here, pay
about $25 grand apiece for me

774
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:03,140
to fire water-powered
bottle rockets at them.

775
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,750
It's a pretty sweet job.

776
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,787
So if you guys are
interested in academia,

777
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:08,370
you know, these
things happen in life.

778
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,100
It's pretty cool.

779
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:10,600
Yeah.

780
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:10,780
All right.

781
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,330
Since I can't think of any
endothermic chemical reactions

782
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,705
off the top of my
head, I'll have

783
00:38:14,705 --> 00:38:16,450
to keep it general
and abstract and say,

784
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,070
if you have an
endothermic reaction,

785
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,770
you have to add energy
in the form of heat

786
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,690
to get the reaction going.

787
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,910
In an endothermic
nuclear reaction,

788
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:26,950
heating up the material
does not impart

789
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,600
very much kinetic energy.

790
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,030
You might raise it from
a fraction of an electron

791
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:33,495
volt to maybe a couple
of electron volts

792
00:38:33,495 --> 00:38:34,870
if things are so
hot that they're

793
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,670
glowing in the ultraviolet.

794
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,620
That doesn't cut it for nuclear.

795
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:42,970
So you have to impart kinetic
energy to the incoming particle

796
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:46,540
such that the kinetic
energy plus the rest masses

797
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,920
is enough to create the rest
masses of the final particles.

798
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,020
And that's the general
explanation I'd give.

799
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,580
I forget who had
asked the question.

800
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,830
But does that help
explain it a bit?

801
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:00,810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

802
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:01,477
PROFESSOR: Cool.

803
00:39:01,477 --> 00:39:02,380
OK.

804
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,190
I'll take five minutes.

805
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:06,970
And let's do a
severely reduced case

806
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,940
of this, the case of
elastic neutron scattering.

807
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,790
It's kind of a flash
forward to what we'll be

808
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,470
doing in the next month or so.

809
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,953
Does everyone have what's
behind this board here?

810
00:39:16,953 --> 00:39:18,620
I know that was, like,
three boards ago.

811
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,010
So I hope so.

812
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:23,073
So let's take the case of
elastic neutron scattering.

813
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:33,760
Remember I told you that
after we developed this highly

814
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,412
general solution
to the Q equation,

815
00:39:35,412 --> 00:39:37,120
everything else that
we're going to study

816
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,040
is just a reduction of that.

817
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,560
And this is about as
reduced as it gets.

818
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,080
So in elastic
neutron scattering,

819
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,010
we can say that M1--

820
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:50,670
well, what's the mass
of a neutron in AMU?

821
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:55,050
And let's forgive our six
decimal points' precision

822
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:55,763
for now.

823
00:39:55,763 --> 00:39:56,430
What's it about?

824
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,190
AUDIENCE: 1.

825
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,160
PROFESSOR: 1.

826
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,621
So we can say that M1 equals 1.

827
00:40:00,621 --> 00:40:03,270
And in the case of
elastic scattering,

828
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,670
the particles bounce
into each other

829
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:08,790
and leave with their
original identities.

830
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,290
So that also equals M3.

831
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:18,180
If we're shooting neutrons at
an arbitrary nucleus, what's M2?

832
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,220
Yep?

833
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:23,850
AUDIENCE: A?

834
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:26,860
PROFESSOR: Just A,
the mass number.

835
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,100
Same as M4.

836
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,470
Now, we don't have
M2 in this equation.

837
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,910
Whatever.

838
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,590
But the point is, yeah.

839
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,740
We're going to use these two.

840
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,650
We're going to use these two.

841
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,000
So let's substitute that in.

842
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,790
Oh, and one last other
thing I mentioned.

843
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:49,506
What is the Q value
for elastic scattering?

844
00:40:49,506 --> 00:40:50,622
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

845
00:40:50,622 --> 00:40:51,330
PROFESSOR: Right.

846
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,390
0.

847
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,060
Because the Q value is
the difference in the rest

848
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:58,000
masses of the ingoing
and outgoing particles.

849
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,540
If the ingoing and outgoing
particles are the same,

850
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:06,010
M1 equals M3, M2 equals
M4, that sum equals 0.

851
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,300
Therefore, Q equals 0.

852
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,610
So let's use these
three things right here

853
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:15,930
and rewrite the general Q
equation in those terms.

854
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:18,200
Which board is it on?

855
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,690
Right there.

856
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,010
So let's copy that down.

857
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:31,900
So let's say we have T1 times
M1 is 1 over M4 is A minus 1

858
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:37,560
minus 2 over M4 is A. This is
where it gets nice and easy.

859
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,640
M1 and M3 are just 1.

860
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,228
So 1 times 1 times T1.

861
00:41:46,228 --> 00:41:47,520
We don't know what that is yet.

862
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,650
So let's call it the Tn, T
of the neutron coming in.

863
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:56,160
How about this?

864
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:04,550
We'll call it T in and T out
for ease of understanding.

865
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,750
Cosine theta.

866
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,040
What do we have left?

867
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:12,160
Plus T out.

868
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,740
And let's make T1 into
an in right there.

869
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,680
Times M3 over M4.

870
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,955
M3 was 1.

871
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:27,150
M4 is A. Plus 1
equals Q, equals 0.

872
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:29,920
This is quite a simpler
equation to solve.

873
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,392
So let's group
this all together.

874
00:42:33,392 --> 00:42:34,850
There's a couple
of tricks that I'm

875
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,392
going to apply right
now to make sure

876
00:42:36,392 --> 00:42:38,590
that everything has
A in the denominator

877
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,180
to make stuff easier.

878
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:44,780
We can call 1 A over A here.

879
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:49,740
We can call 1 A over A there.

880
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,830
That lets us combine
our denominators

881
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:55,370
and stick the sine right there.

882
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:58,430
That becomes an A.
Same thing here.

883
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:02,930
I'll just connect the dashes
and stick the minus sign there,

884
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:05,380
leaving an A right there.

885
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,150
Now we can just
multiply everything

886
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:11,050
by A, both sides
of the equation.

887
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:15,010
So the As go away there.

888
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,835
We have a much simpler equation.

889
00:43:16,835 --> 00:43:20,440
0 equals T in of--

890
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:27,240
let's see-- 1 minus A over 1.

891
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:27,740
OK.

892
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:36,850
We'll just call it 1 minus
A. Minus 2 root T in T

893
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:47,240
out cosine theta
plus T out A plus 1.

894
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,300
And, OK, it's 10 minutes
of, or it's five minutes

895
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,800
of five minutes of.

896
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,420
So I'm going to
stop this right here

897
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,092
at a fairly simple equation.

898
00:43:55,092 --> 00:43:56,300
We'll pick it up on Thursday.

899
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,430
And I want to open the last
five minutes to any questions

900
00:43:58,430 --> 00:43:59,180
you guys may have.

901
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,370
Since that request came
in on the anonymous rant

902
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:06,700
forum, which hopefully
you all know now exists.

903
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,435
Yep.

904
00:44:07,435 --> 00:44:10,405
AUDIENCE: So what exactly
is forward scattering?

905
00:44:10,405 --> 00:44:12,890
I didn't really get that before.

906
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,900
PROFESSOR: So let's look
at elastic scattering

907
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,720
as an example.

908
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,290
So in elastic
scattering, two particles

909
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:20,450
bounce off each other
like billiard balls.

910
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:23,390
In forward elastic
scattering, the neutron,

911
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:27,560
after interacting
somehow with particle 2,

912
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,840
keeps moving forward unscathed.

913
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,460
So in the elastic
scattering sense,

914
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:36,422
forward scattering is
also known as missing.

915
00:44:36,422 --> 00:44:37,400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

916
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,940
PROFESSOR: You can
have other reactions,

917
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,815
let's say, where you
have a particle at rest,

918
00:44:40,815 --> 00:44:45,320
another particle slams into it,
and the whole center of mass

919
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,185
moves together.

920
00:44:46,185 --> 00:44:47,810
I don't know if you'd
call that forward

921
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,310
scattering as much
as, let's say,

922
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:52,410
capture or fusion or something.

923
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:55,700
But in this case, scattering
means that two particles go in,

924
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,710
two particles leave.

925
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,330
Whether it's
elastically, which means

926
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,730
with no transfer of
energy into rest mass,

927
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:03,770
or inelastically,
where, let's say,

928
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:07,280
a neutron is absorbed
and then re-emitted

929
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,690
from a different energy level.

930
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:11,260
And that's something we'll
get into in, like, a month.

931
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,780
So you can have forward elastic
or inelastic scattering.

932
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:16,810
In this case, I'm talking
about elastic scattering, which

933
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:20,470
is the simple case of, like, the
billiard balls miss each other.

934
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:23,080
Which is technically a case
that can be treated by this.

935
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,930
Because all you have to do
is plug in theta equals 0

936
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:28,600
and you have the case
for how much energy

937
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,483
do you think the neutron would
lose if it misses particle 2.

938
00:45:32,483 --> 00:45:33,400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

939
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:33,850
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

940
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:34,770
It wouldn't lose any energy.

941
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:34,970
Right?

942
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:36,510
It would have the same energy.

943
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:38,380
So that's the case for
forward scattering.

944
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:42,080
A neutron, when it interacts
somehow with another particle,

945
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,320
can lose as little as
none of its energy.

946
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,990
If it misses, no one said
it had to lose any energy.

947
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:49,830
And by solving
this equation here,

948
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,650
which we'll do on
Thursday, we'll

949
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:54,500
see what the maximum amount of
energy that neutron can lose

950
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:58,830
is, which is the basis
for neutrons slowing down

951
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:02,350
or moderation in reactors.

952
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:03,330
Yeah.

953
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:07,130
AUDIENCE: Are T in and T out
equal there, in which case

954
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:10,012
that equation is used
to solve for theta?

955
00:46:10,012 --> 00:46:13,660
PROFESSOR: T in and T
out are not always equal.

956
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:17,590
But in the case of forward
elastic scattering,

957
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:18,990
they would be.

958
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:21,540
Because the neutron
comes in with energy T in

959
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:24,390
and it leaves with energy T in.

960
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:27,780
For any other case in
which the neutron comes off

961
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:30,060
of particle 2 at
a different angle,

962
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:34,290
it will have bounced off of
particle 2, moving particle 2

963
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:36,180
at some other angle
phi, and giving it

964
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,540
some of its energy elastically.

965
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:41,180
The total amount of that kinetic
energy will be conserved.

966
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:46,000
So let's say-- what
did we call it?

967
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,500
What is it?

968
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,000
Yeah.

969
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,320
So T1 would have to be
the same as T3 and T4

970
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,520
together for this
Q equation where

971
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,090
Q equals 0 to be satisfied.

972
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:58,500
So what you said can happen.

973
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,097
But it's only the case
for forward scattering.

974
00:47:02,097 --> 00:47:02,930
Any other questions?

975
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,780
Yep.

976
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,650
AUDIENCE: In the case of
an exothermic reaction,

977
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:10,258
we assume that T1 equals 0.

978
00:47:10,258 --> 00:47:13,103
Can you re-explain why
we made that assumption?

979
00:47:13,103 --> 00:47:15,520
PROFESSOR: So the question
was, in an exothermic reaction,

980
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,710
why did we say T1 equals 0?

981
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,270
It's not always the case.

982
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:22,300
But it provides the simplest
case for us to analyze.

983
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:26,560
So an exothermic reaction
can happen when T1 equals 0.

984
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,790
It can also happen when
T1 is greater than 0.

985
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:31,970
So we're not putting any
restrictions on that.

986
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:36,650
But in the case that T1
equals 0, s is destroyed

987
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:39,470
and the harder part
of T is destroyed,

988
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:42,200
making the solution
to this equation very

989
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,970
simple and intuitive.

990
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:47,120
Which is to say that if you
just have two particles that

991
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:51,320
are kind of at rest and
they just merge and fire off

992
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,930
two different pieces
in opposite directions,

993
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:56,180
their energies are
proportional to the ratio

994
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:59,583
of their single mass
to the total mass.

995
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:01,250
So that's like a
center of mass problem.

996
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:04,810
You'll notice also I'm not using
center of mass coordinates.

997
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:08,626
Center of mass coor-- who here
has used those in 801 or 802?

998
00:48:08,626 --> 00:48:10,920
And who here enjoyed
the experience?

999
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:11,460
Oh.

1000
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:11,960
Wow.

1001
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,860
No hands whatsoever.

1002
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:17,540
So center of mass coordinates
and laboratory coordinates

1003
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:20,330
are different ways of
expressing the same thing.

1004
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,460
Usually you can write
simpler equations

1005
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,243
in center of mass coordinates.

1006
00:48:24,243 --> 00:48:26,660
But for most people-- and I'm
going to go with all of you,

1007
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:29,465
since none of you raised your
hand-- it's not that intuitive.

1008
00:48:29,465 --> 00:48:30,590
That's the same way for me.

1009
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:32,360
So that's why I've
made a decision

1010
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,910
to show things in
laboratory coordinates,

1011
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:37,250
so you have a fixed
frame of reference

1012
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:39,650
and not a moving frame of
reference of the center of mass

1013
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,240
of the two particles.

1014
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,480
But the center of mass idea
does kind of make sense here.

1015
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,210
If you have two particles
that are almost touching

1016
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:50,900
and then they touch and they
break into pieces and fly off,

1017
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:54,650
the total amount of momentum
of that center of mass was 0.

1018
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:56,540
And it has to remain 0.

1019
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:59,840
And so each of these particles
will take a differing ratio

1020
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,700
of their masses away.

1021
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:04,720
We already looked at this
for the case of alpha decay,

1022
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,450
where if you have one nucleus
just sitting here-- let's

1023
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:09,190
say there was no T1.

1024
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:12,290
There was just some unstable
T2 that was about to explode

1025
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:13,375
and then it did.

1026
00:49:13,375 --> 00:49:15,130
Remember how we
talked about how the Q

1027
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:18,400
value of an alpha reaction is
not the same energy that you

1028
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,660
see the alpha decay at?

1029
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,010
Same thing right here.

1030
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:25,700
So this Q equation describes
that same situation.

1031
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,290
Notice there's no hint of M1.

1032
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:30,720
There was really
no M1 in the end.

1033
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,590
We don't care what the initial
mass of the particle that

1034
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:35,640
made alpha decay is.

1035
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,990
All we care about is what are
the mass ratios and energy

1036
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:44,470
ratios of the alpha particle
and its recoil nucleus.

1037
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:46,590
So it all does tie together.

1038
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:48,340
That's the neat thing,
is this universal Q

1039
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:51,910
equation can be used to
describe almost everything we're

1040
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:54,550
going to talk about.

1041
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:57,040
So this is as
complex as it gets.

1042
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,530
And from now on, we'll be
looking at simpler reductions

1043
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,850
and specific cases of each one.

1044
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:02,760
So it's five of.

1045
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,177
I want to actually make sure
to get you to your next class

1046
00:50:05,177 --> 00:50:05,695
on time.

1047
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:08,790
And I'll see you
guys on Thursday.
