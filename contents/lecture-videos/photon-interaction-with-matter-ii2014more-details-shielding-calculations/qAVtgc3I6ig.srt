8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,280
MICHAEL SHORT: Today I
want us to go more in-depth

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,092
into the photon
interactions with matter,

10
00:00:27,092 --> 00:00:29,300
and we're going to bring
the theory back to something

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,390
that we can actually
start to use in doing

12
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,440
shielding calculations.

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,260
If you want to find out
how much of this material

14
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,720
do I need to shield
this much gammas,

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,795
we're going to answer
that question today.

16
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:42,170
First I want to
start off, again,

17
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,225
with Compton scattering
because I messed up

18
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:46,100
a couple of the energy
things from last time.

19
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,610
I got excited due to an
energetic coincidence

20
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,520
between the photo peak and
the continent of our banana

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,600
spectrum and one of the
examples in the book.

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,360
So I'm going to
correct that now,

23
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,813
and we'll go through in
more mathematical detail

24
00:00:58,813 --> 00:01:00,230
why that wasn't
the case, and what

25
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,063
the actual quirk of
physics is because there

26
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:04,430
is a constant energy
thing here that I

27
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,650
want to highlight to you guys.

28
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,640
So skipping ahead on the
photoelectric effect,

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,540
which I think was similar,
to review Compton scattering.

30
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,510
It's the same thing that we
saw between two particles,

31
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,610
except now one of
them is a photon.

32
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,370
And like I said, on the next
homework, after quiz one,

33
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,890
you guys will be doing
the balance between energy

34
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,953
and momentum, because the
photons don't really have mass,

35
00:01:24,953 --> 00:01:26,870
in order to figure out
what's the relationship

36
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,900
between the incoming
energy of the photon,

37
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,060
the outgoing energy
of the photon,

38
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,785
and the recoil energy
of the electron.

39
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,830
And so these are
the relationships

40
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,190
we were showing last time.

41
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,220
It is an interesting
quirk of physics

42
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,280
that the wavelength
shift itself does not

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,440
depend on the energy of
the photon coming in.

44
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,520
As you can see, it just depends
on the angle that it scatters

45
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,030
at and a bunch of constants,
where that m right there stands

46
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,080
for mass of the electron.

47
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,050
Now that wavelength shift--
while that wavelength shift

48
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,050
does not depend on the energy
of the incoming photon--

49
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,670
the recoil energy does.

50
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,690
You can see it depends on
both the energy and the angle.

51
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,920
And the incoming energy
of the photon equals h nu.

52
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,948
And to give that quick
primer on photon things,

53
00:02:14,948 --> 00:02:16,990
I want to show you guys
here why that's the case.

54
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,110
So even if you have a
constant wavelength shift

55
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,180
that might give you a
non-constant energy shift.

56
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,310
So even though in this
constant scattering formula,

57
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,700
the wavelength shift only
matters with the angle,

58
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,440
the energy shift
actually depends

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,440
on the angle and the incoming
energy of the photon.

60
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,680
So now let's look at a
couple of limiting cases.

61
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:46,730
So as we have e of the
photon equals h nu goes to 0,

62
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,170
what does t approach?

63
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,625
The recoil energy
of the electron.

64
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,500
Let's just do out the formula.

65
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,440
This recoil energy
equals h nu, which

66
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,160
is the energy of the
incoming gamma times 1

67
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:11,640
minus cosine theta over mc
squared over h nu plus 1

68
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,700
minus cosine theta.

69
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,954
As h nu approaches
0, what happens here?

70
00:03:18,954 --> 00:03:19,840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

71
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,673
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

72
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:22,750
H nu goes to 0.

73
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,260
This fraction goes to infinity.

74
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,030
And this goes to 0.

75
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,580
Hopefully that's an
intuitive explanation.

76
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,850
If the incoming
photon has 0 energy,

77
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,160
it can transfer 0
energy to the electron.

78
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,410
Now the more interesting case.

79
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:46,822
What happens now as e
gamma approaches infinity,

80
00:03:46,822 --> 00:03:48,780
as the photon gets higher
and higher in energy?

81
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,772
AUDIENCE: T just
approaches h nu.

82
00:03:56,772 --> 00:03:58,658
MICHAEL SHORT: T
approaches almost h nu.

83
00:03:58,658 --> 00:04:00,950
I actually want to do a quick
calculation without doing

84
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,270
all the limit math.

85
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,970
Let's say we had
energy of the gamma

86
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:10,922
was 1 GeV, an
extremely high energy.

87
00:04:10,922 --> 00:04:12,380
So all we'd plug
in-- and let's say

88
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,660
we wanted to find out
what's the maximum energy

89
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,815
of this recoil electron.

90
00:04:15,815 --> 00:04:17,690
And this is something
I want to ask you guys.

91
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,398
I can't remember.

92
00:04:18,398 --> 00:04:24,950
Yesterday did we say that
t is a maximum at theta

93
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,810
equals pi or pi over 2?

94
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,320
What did we say yesterday?

95
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,240
AUDIENCE: Pi over 2.

96
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,365
MICHAEL SHORT: Interesting.

97
00:04:30,365 --> 00:04:31,790
It's pi, actually.

98
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,430
The case where you have the
largest energy transfer--

99
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,440
and sorry for not
catching that--

100
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,660
is just like in a
nuclear collision,

101
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,090
if the photon were
to back scatter,

102
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,580
it transfers the maximum
energy to the electron.

103
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,130
So the analogy here
is, like, perfect.

104
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,920
Between two particles
hitting and between a photon

105
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,160
and a particle hitting,
the maximum energy

106
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,780
is when theta equals pi.

107
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,360
And let's actually plug
that in to find out why.

108
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,490
If we say t max equals h nu--
depends on the electron coming

109
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,420
in--

110
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:12,350
1 minus cosine theta over
mc squared over h nu plus 1

111
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,340
minus cosine theta.

112
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,760
At theta equals pi, cosine
theta goes to minus 1,

113
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,740
and so then that
also goes to minus 1.

114
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:34,738
And so this becomes 2h nu over
mc squared over h nu plus 2.

115
00:05:34,738 --> 00:05:36,780
And so that without worrying
about the numerator,

116
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,380
especially in the limit of
very high energy photons,

117
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,310
you can see that that actually
maximizes the recoil energy

118
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,630
of the electron.

119
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,630
The reason we're harping so
much on this recoil energy

120
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,990
of the electron is because
that's what we measure.

121
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,730
So when we look at
our banana spectrum,

122
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,300
you're not measuring the
energy of the photon.

123
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,130
You're measuring
the recoil energy

124
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,860
of the electron and
the ionization cascade

125
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,870
that happens as all
those electrons smash

126
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,750
into each other, creating
electron whole pairs, which

127
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,722
are counted as current.

128
00:06:09,722 --> 00:06:11,680
If you guys remember from
last class-- in fact,

129
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,450
I'll just bring up
the blackboard image

130
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,950
because we can do that.

131
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,500
So I took a picture of
the board yesterday,

132
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,300
photon interactions Part 1.

133
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:28,960
There it is.

134
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,540
We'll just use the screen as
a bigger blackboard for now.

135
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,280
So if you guys
remember, let's say

136
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,430
a gamma ray comes in and
causes a Compton scatter

137
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,250
event or a photoelectric
emission, or whatever.

138
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,960
It doesn't matter which process.

139
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,870
And it liberates an electron,
either by scattering off of it

140
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,610
or just getting absorbed
and ejecting it.

141
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,010
Or it doesn't really
matter how, but it creates

142
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,870
this electron hole pair.

143
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,650
That electron right here
has this recoil energy,

144
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,482
which depends on theta,
the angle that it scatters

145
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:00,190
and the incoming.

146
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,620
Energy and that
electron's going to keep

147
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,750
moving in this
material, knocking

148
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,930
into other electrons
very, very efficiently so

149
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:11,170
that most of the energy
of that electron recoil

150
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:14,380
actually gets counted as
other electrons being freed.

151
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,940
We're going to go over on--

152
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,180
well, next Friday-- electron
nuclear interactions,

153
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,810
including what's the
probability in energy transfer

154
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,930
when electrons slam
into each other

155
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,520
or when ions slam into
electrons or each other?

156
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,570
So let me go back to the slides.

157
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:40,900
And so this maximum, as
this approaches infinity,

158
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:50,290
this actually approaches a
value of h nu minus .255 MeV

159
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,840
Just to do the quick calculation
to give a numerical example,

160
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,940
if I plug in theta
equals pi and h mu

161
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:04,630
equals 1 gig electron
volt, or 1,000 MeV.

162
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,470
And can anyone remind me what is
mass of the electron c squared?

163
00:08:12,228 --> 00:08:13,770
What's the rest mass
of the electron?

164
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,855
Sorry?

165
00:08:14,855 --> 00:08:15,730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

166
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,190
MICHAEL SHORT: Right.

167
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,730
While I'm usually against
memorizing anything--

168
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,520
because that's what books
and the internet are for--

169
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,130
this is one of those
quantities that I

170
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,740
want on the tip of your
tongue as nuclear engineers.

171
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,990
You should remember what the
rest mass of the electron

172
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,600
is because a lot
of our quantities

173
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,640
are calculated based upon it.

174
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,980
For example, this ratio--

175
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,770
what was it, h nu
over MeC squared--

176
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,020
gives you the energy
the photon in terms

177
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,450
of the number of
electron rest masses,

178
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,557
which is a useful
quantity in itself.

179
00:08:47,557 --> 00:08:49,140
So why don't I plug
all this stuff in.

180
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:58,650
So we have .511 over 1,000 plus
2 flipped over the x-axis times

181
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,070
2 times h nu.

182
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:13,830
And we get-- so that
t becomes 999.745 MeV.

183
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,640
Interestingly enough, 1,000
MeV, our ingoing photon,

184
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:25,630
minus that equals
that right there.

185
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,380
So that's the interesting
quirk of physics

186
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,460
is as the photon
increases in energy,

187
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,617
the maximum amount of energy
that it can leave with--

188
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:36,200
or sorry, the minimum
amount of energy

189
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,290
the photon can leave with,
or the maximum amount

190
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:43,260
it can impart to an
electron approaches

191
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,580
.255 MeV or the photon
energy minus that.

192
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,330
What do you guys notice
about that number?

193
00:09:52,274 --> 00:09:53,253
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

194
00:09:53,253 --> 00:09:54,420
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

195
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,510
It's exactly half the
rest mass of the electron.

196
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,620
So as your photons hit
the GeV range and above,

197
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,768
they can all leave
with half the rest

198
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:05,310
mass of the electron
of energy, which

199
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,850
means you have more and more
energy able to be transferred

200
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,820
in a given Compton
scatter as the photon gets

201
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,770
higher and higher in energy.

202
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:17,490
So for the limit of
low energy, the photons

203
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,370
basically bounce off without
transferring much energy

204
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,360
at all.

205
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,400
And the higher in
energy the photon gets,

206
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,970
the higher percentage of
that maximum transfer can be.

207
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,580
So that's what I wanted
to clarify from last time.

208
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,990
It was an interesting
coincidence

209
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,810
that our photo peak
and our Compton edge

210
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,480
were pretty close to
that number apart.

211
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,440
But one MeV isn't
quite infinity.

212
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,440
But it is pretty close.

213
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,200
That difference right there,
what does that come out to?

214
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,430
Before I say something stupid,
I'll just calculate it.

215
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,410
1.241.

216
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,290
It's like 0.218 MeV, so we're
already most of the way there.

217
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,140
So once you reach,
like, 10 or 100 MeV,

218
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,870
you're pretty much
at that limit.

219
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,050
And so what that tells
you is that the distance

220
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,500
between a photo peak and
its corresponding Compton

221
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,190
edge for high energy photons
is going to be half the rest

222
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,090
mass of the electron.

223
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,400
Once you get to lower
and lower energies,

224
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,813
that distance will
start to shrink.

225
00:11:17,813 --> 00:11:18,980
I'm sorry, other way around.

226
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,260
That distance will
start to grow.

227
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,380
And I have a few examples
I want to show you.

228
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,410
But first, in order
to understand these,

229
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,160
now I want to get into
the part I told you

230
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,930
we'd get to yesterday,
which is what's

231
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,020
the probability that a
Compton scatter happens

232
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,520
at a certain angle?

233
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,980
And this polar plot
explains it pretty well.

234
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,860
In the limit of
really low photons,

235
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,360
like .01 MeV or 10
keV photons, you

236
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,600
can see that this forward
scattering to an angle of 0,

237
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,790
or back scattering
to an angle of 180--

238
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,240
there's a 180 that's blocked
by an axis right there--

239
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,250
they're almost the same.

240
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,980
So forward and back
scattering, there's

241
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,920
not really that much of a big
difference in probability.

242
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,780
So if we were going to start
graphing theta of this Compton

243
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,570
scatter as a function of the--

244
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,330
going to introduce this new
quantity, this angularly

245
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,912
dependent cross-section.

246
00:12:16,912 --> 00:12:18,620
Before we were giving
you cross- sections

247
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,200
in the form of just
sigmas, like sigma Compton.

248
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:25,370
Now we're actually
telling you what's

249
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,970
the probability of that
interaction happening

250
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,953
in this certain angle?

251
00:12:30,953 --> 00:12:32,870
So it's called the
differential cross-section,

252
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,287
and you can have all sorts of
differential cross-sections,

253
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,820
like energy differential
cross-sections,

254
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,800
angle differential
cross-sections,

255
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,860
whatever have you.

256
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,340
So if we try and graph what dpes
the shape of this look like,

257
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,310
this polar plot on a more
understandable graph,

258
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,350
we can see that the
probability is pretty high.

259
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,950
Let's just call that a
relative probability of 1.

260
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,740
And as we trace
around this circle,

261
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,380
that value gets lower and
lower until we hit 90 degrees,

262
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,400
or pi over 2, at which point
it starts to pop back up

263
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,710
almost to its original value.

264
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:13,490
So this was for a 10 keV photon.

265
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,010
Now let's take a
different extreme example.

266
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,870
We have a 3 MeV
photon right here.

267
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:22,650
And it's that long dashed curve,
so that one here in the center.

268
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,080
So we can see that the relative
probability of 0 degrees

269
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,580
is the same.

270
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,230
And if we trace
around to 180, we're

271
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,220
almost at the origin, which
tells us that, for 3 MeV,

272
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,750
it starts off the same and
quickly drops really far down.

273
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,090
What that means is that what's
called forward scattering

274
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,245
is preferred.

275
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,780
So up on this board,
we were talking

276
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,290
about what's the maximum energy
that a photon can transfer,

277
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,750
which is always in the
back scattering case.

278
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,630
The other part to note is
that that back scattering

279
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,780
probability gets lower and
lower as the photon gets

280
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,310
higher and higher in energy.

281
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,600
Yeah.

282
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,267
AUDIENCE: So it's
that basically saying,

283
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:10,245
since we said forward
scattering [INAUDIBLE]

284
00:14:10,245 --> 00:14:11,998
as the energy gets
higher, you just

285
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:15,872
have a harder chance
of it interacting.

286
00:14:15,872 --> 00:14:16,830
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

287
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,190
Yeah.

288
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,815
The cross-section
value, well, yeah, it

289
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:21,480
goes down as you
increase in energy.

290
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,470
So a total forward scatter, if
you had a true forward scatter

291
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:30,810
where theta equals 0,
I'll call that a miss.

292
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,880
It means that, because
we saw on this formula

293
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:39,840
up here when theta equals 0,
there is no energy transfer.

294
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,040
Nothing.

295
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,140
And so yeah, that would
be to me like a miss.

296
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,140
If that angles ever
so slightly above 0,

297
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,890
then there is some
scattering, but there's

298
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,990
very little energy transfer.

299
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,690
But that smaller
energy transfer becomes

300
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:56,340
more likely when the photon
goes higher in energy.

301
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,250
These are these sorts of
cause and effect relationships

302
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,440
I want you guys to be
able to reason out.

303
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,680
If I were to give you a polar
plot of this differential

304
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,960
cross-section with
angle and energy,

305
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,020
I'd want you to be able to
reproduce this and tell me

306
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,070
what's really going on.

307
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,410
If we fill in one of
the ones in between--

308
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:20,260
let's go with 0.2 MeV, this
sort of single dashed line--

309
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,990
you can see that the
probability of back scattering

310
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:27,250
is somewhere between the
3 MeV and the 10 keV.

311
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,010
Yeah, Luke?

312
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,880
AUDIENCE: Back scattering
refers to the photon going back.

313
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,047
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

314
00:15:32,047 --> 00:15:35,680
Back scattering refers to the
photon going back, which means

315
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,560
this situation,
where the difference

316
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,290
in angle between the
incoming and outgoing photon

317
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,470
is pi, 180 degrees, which means
it just turns around and moves

318
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,490
the other way.

319
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,960
Right.

320
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,760
So that dashed line right
there would follow something

321
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,310
like this at-- what did we say?

322
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,720
0.2 MeV.

323
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,480
The form, the full form of
this cross-section right

324
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,540
here is referred to as the
Klein-Nishina cross-section.

325
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,170
And it has been derived by
quantum electro dynamics, which

326
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,180
I will not derive for you now.

327
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,800
But there are plenty
of derivations

328
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,088
online if that's
your kind of thing.

329
00:16:14,088 --> 00:16:15,880
And I had to make a
trade-off in this class

330
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,760
of how deep do we go into
each concept versus how

331
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,660
many concepts do we teach?

332
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,040
And I'm going for the
latter because if there

333
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,748
is any course that's
supposed to give you

334
00:16:24,748 --> 00:16:26,470
an overview of
nuclear, it's 22.01.

335
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,060
There will be plenty of time
for quantum in 22.02 and beyond,

336
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,690
should you want.

337
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,402
At any rate, this is
the general form of it.

338
00:16:34,402 --> 00:16:35,860
And what this
actually tells you is

339
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,010
that as the energy of
the photon increases,

340
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:42,367
the effect of that angle will--

341
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,700
you guys'll have to work that
out on a homework problem.

342
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,630
I just remembered.

343
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,130
I want to stop
stealing your thunder

344
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,547
and giving away
half the homework.

345
00:16:48,547 --> 00:16:49,700
Yep.

346
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,022
AUDIENCE: How does [INAUDIBLE]?

347
00:16:57,988 --> 00:16:58,780
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

348
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,990
AUDIENCE: --the quantity
D sigma D omega.

349
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,850
MICHAEL SHORT: The
quantity D sigma D

350
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:07,810
omega says let's say you have a
photon coming in at our x-axis.

351
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,790
You've got an electron here.

352
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:13,829
What's the probability that
I'm going to scatter off

353
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:17,369
into some small area d omega?

354
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:25,250
So in some small d theta d
phi, or some small sine theta,

355
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:30,012
d theta d phi, into an
element of solid angle.

356
00:17:30,012 --> 00:17:31,470
I should probably
draw that smaller

357
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,650
to be a little more
differential looking.

358
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,220
So gammas are going to
scatter off in all directions.

359
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,227
But this d sigma
d omega tells you

360
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,810
what's the probability that it
goes through that little patch?

361
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:52,370
AUDIENCE: And then that omega is
also a function of [INAUDIBLE]??

362
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:57,970
MICHAEL SHORT: So that omega has
some component of theta in it

363
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,550
and some component of phi in it.

364
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,050
Since it's a solid
angle, it depends

365
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,530
on both the angle of rotation
and the angle of inclination,

366
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,510
which we call theta and phi.

367
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,930
Now to get from this to the
regular cross-section you're

368
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:17,710
used to, you can integrate
over all angles omega

369
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,592
of the differential
cross-section,

370
00:18:20,592 --> 00:18:22,800
and you'll get the regular
total cross-section, which

371
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,530
is just what is the probability
of Compton scattering,

372
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,022
full stop.

373
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,480
If you wanted to
know, then, what's

374
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,500
the probability of Compton
scattering into this angle,

375
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,850
it sounds kind of boring, right?

376
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,500
Why do we care about the angle?

377
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,708
Anyone bored yet?

378
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:37,750
You can raise your hands.

379
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,540
Be honest.

380
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,230
Interesting.

381
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,920
OK.

382
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,340
Well, I'm going to tell you
why it's not boring because I

383
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,200
don't think you're honest.

384
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,620
You can actually, if you know
the angle at which a Compton

385
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,880
photon scatters into--

386
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,640
actually I want to
leave that stuff up--

387
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,760
there is a pretty much
one to one relation

388
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,570
between the energy and
the angle of scattering,

389
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:07,240
which means that let's say
you have a cargo container.

390
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,740
I'm sorry.

391
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,600
You don't have a
cargo container.

392
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,570
You have a cargo ship full
of tons and tons of these

393
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,030
stacked up cargo containers.

394
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,960
Has anyone actually ever
seen one of these before?

395
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,460
OK.

396
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,980
In case not, I'm going
to do something dangerous

397
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,180
and go to the internet.

398
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,030
And hopefully the search
for cargo container

399
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,820
doesn't come up with
something disgusting.

400
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,480
Oh, look at that.

401
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,230
How about cargo container ship?

402
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,120
Yeah.

403
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,330
OK.

404
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,000
You got one of these, right?

405
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,340
And your detector
goes off, and it just

406
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,170
says there is something
radioactive that

407
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,520
shouldn't be here.

408
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,110
How do you find
out which container

409
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,900
it's in without
taking the ship apart?

410
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,740
Interesting problem, huh?

411
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,090
Do you just kind of look-- yeah?

412
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,590
AUDIENCE: Do you
kind of like shield

413
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,336
certain angles [INAUDIBLE]?

414
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,200
MICHAEL SHORT: That's one way.

415
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,880
You could mask off the ship
and move your detector around,

416
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,070
and then do it for the
other two dimensions.

417
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,443
So that will get you
there, but slowly.

418
00:20:12,443 --> 00:20:13,485
How do you do it quickly?

419
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:20,240
Well, you do it with the
Klein Nishina cross-section.

420
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,060
If you know the relationship
between the energy

421
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,280
and the angle of
a Compton scatter,

422
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,630
you take two detectors,
Detector 1, Detector 2,

423
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,580
and you form what's
called a Compton camera.

424
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,220
This is awesome because
with two detectors,

425
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,390
you can pinpoint the location of
a radiation source by knowing--

426
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:48,410
let's say you had a gamma
ray that entered Detector 1.

427
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,750
So you have your
initial e gamma.

428
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,160
And you get a spectrum.

429
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,745
Let's draw a couple of spectra.

430
00:20:54,745 --> 00:20:56,120
I'm going to use
different colors

431
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,710
so I can make them bigger.

432
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:03,420
This will be intensity
and this will be energy.

433
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:07,130
So we have our blue
Detector 1, and we

434
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,640
have some spectrum
for Detector 1

435
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,180
where we get the photo peak
of the gamma at e gamma.

436
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:18,350
And this time, you don't
see every possible angle.

437
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:23,935
You only see whatever angle you
get that Compton scatter at.

438
00:21:23,935 --> 00:21:26,060
Or you might see a whole
bunch of different angles.

439
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,900
Never mind.

440
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,250
So you're going
to see the Compton

441
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,700
edge in this whole
continuum of things.

442
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,100
And so you know that whatever
energy this corresponds

443
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,040
to means that theta equals pi.

444
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,240
That energy corresponds
to theta equals 0.

445
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,440
And you know that there's
a source somewhere in here.

446
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,090
Now let's say that photon
scatters out of Detector 1

447
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,690
and into Detector 2.

448
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,610
In this case, you've
no longer just

449
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,350
know that you have a
source of some sort.

450
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,740
You'll end up with
a certain photo peak

451
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:06,650
corresponding to this e
gamma prime, the only energy

452
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:09,780
that can Compton scatter in
the direction from Detector 1

453
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,710
to Detector 2,
because you have now

454
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:16,610
determined the angles between
the line between the detectors

455
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,540
and the detector at the source.

456
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:25,770
So then you get a photo peak and
the corresponding Compton edge

457
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:28,180
for your e gamma prime.

458
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,200
Your e gamma prime, that tells
you the angle that it came off

459
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,640
of for your first interaction.

460
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,980
So that is your source angle.

461
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,010
So what that means is that
by using these two angles,

462
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:48,930
you've now pinpointed your
source to lie somewhere

463
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:57,730
on these two cones projected
back on one of the two points

464
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,470
where those cones at
that angle intersect.

465
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,420
This is something I want
you to try and think

466
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,530
about and work out on your own.

467
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:10,292
But it's really cool to explain
this because with one detector,

468
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:12,000
you know that there's
a source somewhere,

469
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,830
and you know generally
where to point.

470
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:17,100
With two detectors
and energy resolution,

471
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,400
the energy of the photo
peak of the second event

472
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,268
tells you what the angle
of the first event was.

473
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:24,810
And this way, if
you know what source

474
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,007
you're looking for from
the first photo peak,

475
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:28,590
and you know what
angle you're looking

476
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:32,190
for from the Compton
scattered photons photo

477
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,950
peak, because they
have those, then you

478
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,452
know not only what the
source is, but where it is.

479
00:23:37,452 --> 00:23:38,910
And you know which
container should

480
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,115
take a part to start looking.

481
00:23:41,115 --> 00:23:43,240
So this is why we care
about angle, because there's

482
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,170
actual, real ways of using
this to your advantage

483
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:50,390
to solve some pretty insane
problems, like which container

484
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,500
would that be in.

485
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,030
Who's starting to get the
general idea behind a Compton

486
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:58,858
camera, or who would
like another explanation?

487
00:23:58,858 --> 00:24:00,713
Anyone?

488
00:24:00,713 --> 00:24:01,630
I asked two questions.

489
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,682
So who would like
another explanation?

490
00:24:03,682 --> 00:24:05,050
Yeah, OK.

491
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,360
The idea here is with
just one detector,

492
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,742
all you know is whether
or not there is a source.

493
00:24:09,742 --> 00:24:11,200
The only information
you're getting

494
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,920
is its photo peak and
Compton edge and bowl.

495
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,170
And so you know the
identity of the source.

496
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:19,180
Maybe it's cobalt
60 or something.

497
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,950
But you don't know where it is.

498
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,410
By making a second
measurement, you

499
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,590
can then determine
where on the Compton

500
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,860
spectrum of the
first measurement

501
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,660
does the photon lie.

502
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,910
So by saying OK, the
photo peak corresponds

503
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,490
to this energy,
which corresponds

504
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:43,320
to some certain angle that
this had to scatter off of.

505
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,770
So then you know
what this angle is.

506
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,423
You've determined theta.

507
00:24:49,423 --> 00:24:51,340
AUDIENCE: Is that the
same theta that you just

508
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,248
drew as theta angle?

509
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,040
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

510
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,540
OK.

511
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,985
Angle.

512
00:24:56,985 --> 00:24:58,360
You've then
determined this angle

513
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,970
because you know the
incoming path of the photon,

514
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:03,550
and you now know
the outgoing path,

515
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,740
which means you know angle.

516
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:09,220
So if you know the line
between these two detectors,

517
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:13,480
and your photo pick lines
up with your first Compton

518
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,070
spectrum's angle, you then
look at that angle back.

519
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:21,040
You also have to sweep around
in the other direction, which

520
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,220
means you end up with a
cone of possible locations.

521
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:24,862
Yeah.

522
00:25:24,862 --> 00:25:26,612
AUDIENCE: How do you
know that the photons

523
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:30,172
that get to the second scatter
from inside the first one?

524
00:25:30,172 --> 00:25:31,880
MICHAEL SHORT: There
can be only a couple

525
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,890
of things that
could happen, right?

526
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,650
You could have another
direct photon just

527
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,880
shoot into Detector
2, in which case

528
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,420
you'll just get a little
bit of photo peak.

529
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,300
But we know to expect
that, so we can ignore it.

530
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,220
We're specifically
looking for the photo peek

531
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,940
coming from Detector 1.

532
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,180
AUDIENCE: So they wouldn't
just go in the air

533
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,990
and do Compton
scatter [INAUDIBLE]??

534
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:57,680
MICHAEL SHORT: They would,
which gives the perfect pretext

535
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,170
to bring up the cross-sections
for these processes.

536
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:04,010
So I'm going to skip
ahead a little bit

537
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,740
and start getting into what do
the actual cross-sections look

538
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,830
like for Compton scattering,
photoelectric, and pair

539
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,820
production?

540
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,280
All of them have to
do with the electron

541
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,350
density of the material.

542
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,510
The more electrons
in the way, the more

543
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,250
you get these events happening.

544
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:22,040
So yes, you will get
Compton scatters in the air

545
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,250
because air contains electrons
and they do Compton scatter.

546
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,460
But air is not
very dense, so you

547
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,940
will get comparatively less.

548
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,140
So let's say that adds
a little bit of noise

549
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,780
on the bottom, which is like
any detector spectrum we've ever

550
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,280
seen.

551
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,020
There's always noise from
all sorts of other processes

552
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,030
we're not looking for.

553
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,690
So now let's start
to look at what

554
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:46,407
the general energy and z ranges
of each of these effects are.

555
00:26:46,407 --> 00:26:48,240
And we're going to
recreate one of the plots

556
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,350
that I showed you at the
beginning of yesterday's class.

557
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:56,100
So let's make a graph
of energy of the photon

558
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,260
and z of the material.

559
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,650
And we want to try to map
out where the following three

560
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,030
processes are dominant.

561
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:06,000
So tau, our
photoelectric effect.

562
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:14,830
C, which we'll call
our Compton scattering.

563
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:18,411
And kappa, which we'll
call pair production.

564
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,860
And these cross-sections do
give us relative probabilities

565
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,280
as a function of the energy
of the photon and the medium

566
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,830
they're going through, along
with the actual density,

567
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:33,060
that something's
going to happen.

568
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,110
So let's look at
the form of these.

569
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:38,420
The cross-section for the
photoelectric effect scales

570
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,840
with z to the 5th.

571
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,430
Do you think that
photoelectric effect

572
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:47,124
will be more likely for
low z or high z materials?

573
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:48,110
AUDIENCE: High.

574
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,735
MICHAEL SHORT: High
z materials, right.

575
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:52,730
So we know we're going to
be in the top half area.

576
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:56,575
And it scales with one
over energy to the 7/2.

577
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:57,950
So do you think
this will be most

578
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,410
likely with low or high energy?

579
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,128
AUDIENCE: Low.

580
00:28:04,128 --> 00:28:05,420
MICHAEL SHORT: So lower energy.

581
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:10,140
So we're going to fill in
our photoelectric somewhat.

582
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,280
Oh, I'm sorry.

583
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,530
So we know it's going to
be in this part of the z.

584
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,947
We know it's going to be in
this part of the energy curve.

585
00:28:15,947 --> 00:28:21,320
So let's fill in that
area as photoelectric.

586
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,450
Let's look at the other
extreme, pair production.

587
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,300
It scales with z
squared, so is that

588
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,130
going to be in the low
or the high z area?

589
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

590
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,610
MICHAEL SHORT: I
think still high,

591
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,440
just the bigger the z, the
bigger the cross-section,

592
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,100
right?

593
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,540
So we know that
pair production is

594
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,220
going to be in the high z area.

595
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,780
Now how about the energy?

596
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,850
It scales with
the log of energy,

597
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,530
but the energy is on the top.

598
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:54,740
So will a low or a high energy
give you more pair production?

599
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,240
High.

600
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,110
So pair production
is going to be here,

601
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:04,440
leaving everything else
for Compton scattering.

602
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,020
And if we jump back to
the start of last class,

603
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,260
we've reproduced from the
cross-sections the same sort

604
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:16,210
of plot that we saw
before just from looking

605
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:20,450
at the relative probabilities
of each effect, which

606
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,160
I think it's pretty cool.

607
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,100
We can now do that with some
basic physics knowledge.

608
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,070
Last thing I want to fill in
for Compton scattering is that

609
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:35,400
the Klein Nishina cross-section,
which is your differential

610
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,310
cross-section as a
function of omega,

611
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:44,520
combined with the probability
that you scatter into a certain

612
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,910
angle and a certain energy--
because there's a one-to-one

613
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,530
relationship--

614
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,690
ends up giving
you your d sigma c

615
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:58,030
over de, which is your energy
distribution of Compton recoil

616
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,380
electrons.

617
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,490
And that's directly what
leads to the shape right here,

618
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:05,650
where if you have,
let's say, 0.51 MeV,

619
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:08,810
relatively low energy, there's--

620
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:11,210
let's see.

621
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,650
What do I want to say here?

622
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:14,150
Yeah.

623
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:17,240
So as you go up in
higher and higher energy,

624
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,340
you get fewer and fewer
Compton electrons,

625
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,190
because like Jared was
saying, the probability

626
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,870
of a Compton
interaction does go down

627
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:26,900
with increasing energy, as
we kind of reasoned out.

628
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:31,190
But in addition, you
get relatively more

629
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:34,880
of these back scattered ones,
which is kind of interesting.

630
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,308
I have to think about that one.

631
00:30:36,308 --> 00:30:38,100
But this is the typical
shape that you tend

632
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,680
to see for Compton scattering.

633
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,560
For high energy photons, you
get a Compton peak and then

634
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,830
a very long, shallow tail.

635
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:49,010
And as you go lower
and lower energy,

636
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,900
it starts to sort
of bounce back up.

637
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,650
And yeah, Luke?

638
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,840
AUDIENCE: When Compton
scattering happens,

639
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,230
are the electrons being
knocked off the atom?

640
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,230
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, yeah.

641
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,772
AUDIENCE: OK.

642
00:30:58,772 --> 00:31:01,160
So how is that different from
the photoelectric effect?

643
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,785
MICHAEL SHORT: The
photoelectric effect

644
00:31:02,785 --> 00:31:04,920
is an absorption
followed by an injection.

645
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,250
In Compton scattering, the
other photon is still intact.

646
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,880
It just loses energy,
gains wavelength.

647
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,700
But the energy of Compton
scattering is-- let's say,

648
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,120
for MeV photons, it's on the
order of hundreds of keV--

649
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,298
plenty to eject most of
the electrons from an atom.

650
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:22,840
So you always have
to think about are

651
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,250
you going to eject something?

652
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,200
Are you above the work function?

653
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,290
Work function for most atoms--

654
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,230
so we had a nice plot of that--

655
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,140
is in the eV range.

656
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,300
So chances are, yeah,
Compton scattering mostly

657
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,280
is going to be ejecting
electrons, too.

658
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,350
That's the whole reason
we can count them.

659
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,450
If there wasn't an
electron ejection,

660
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:45,300
there would be no electron
ionization cascade to count.

661
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,880
So there's some sort of
empirical or experimental proof

662
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,670
that it does happen.

663
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:52,130
And speaking of
experimental proof,

664
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,720
you can actually see that shape.

665
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,470
In this case, this is a spectrum
taken from two different gamma

666
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:02,900
sources together, a-- what is
it, 1.28 MeV and a 0.51 Mev.

667
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,270
And you can see that the
1.28 MeV, first of all,

668
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,730
has a way lower
number of counts,

669
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,650
showing that the
cross-section does,

670
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:12,500
indeed, decrease
with higher energy.

671
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,210
And it doesn't have-- well,
you can't really even see--

672
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,620
but it does not curving
back up, whereas this lower

673
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,230
energy Compton
photon is scattering

674
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,630
more often because
it's much higher,

675
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:28,273
and it's got that bump back
up at the really low energies.

676
00:32:28,273 --> 00:32:29,690
So it's kind of
neat when the math

677
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:33,230
that we're looking at, if I jump
ahead to the cross-sections,

678
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:36,770
you can see that you'd
expect the Compton scattering

679
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,800
to decrease with energy.

680
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,650
And you look at an experimental
plot of two different energies,

681
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:45,000
and there you have
it, higher energy,

682
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,060
less total Compton scattering,
but different shape.

683
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,900
So any questions before
I move on to how you can

684
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,618
use them to design shielding?

685
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:04,940
So what we're getting
here, these cross-sections,

686
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,220
are probably better
known to some of you

687
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,280
as mass attenuation
coefficients, which

688
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,600
are simpler ways of
describing how many photons

689
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,410
in a narrow beam would
undergo some sort of process

690
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,570
and be removed from the beam.

691
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,670
And they get removed
exponentially

692
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,070
for the same sort of reason
for pretty much everything

693
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,710
in this class ends up being
an exponential, doesn't it?

694
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:33,080
Where if you have some
intensity of photons

695
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,300
or some change in
intensity that's

696
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:40,080
proportional to a change
in x in the initial--

697
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,610
let's see-- and some--

698
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:45,460
what is it, concept
of proportionality

699
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,580
like the cross-section,
or we'll call it now mu,

700
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,890
this mass attenuation
coefficient.

701
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,140
The answer to that ends up
being pretty much the same.

702
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,520
And it's this simple
exponential thing.

703
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,035
And the nice thing
is you don't have

704
00:34:00,035 --> 00:34:02,660
to calculate all these different
cross-sections because they're

705
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,330
tabulated for you by NIST.

706
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,190
And that's one of the
links on the website,

707
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,815
on the learning modules website
that I want to show to you guys

708
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:10,639
now.

709
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,090
You can actually look up these
total summed cross-sections

710
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:16,489
for gamma ray
interactions as a function

711
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:19,850
of energy versus their mass
attenuation coefficient

712
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,883
in centimeters squared per gram.

713
00:34:22,883 --> 00:34:24,300
The reason it's
in that unit is it

714
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,880
just tells you what
the material does.

715
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,330
It doesn't tell you how
much you have in the way.

716
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:33,409
And that's why I've rewritten
this exponential attenuation

717
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:36,260
formula with a rho on
the bottom and a rho

718
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,409
on the top, that rho being
the density of the material

719
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:42,590
because usually you can just
say, it's like i naught e

720
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,030
to the mu x.

721
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,940
But these are the things that
you'll look up in tables.

722
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,370
And these rhos right
here is whatever density

723
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,239
you have of your material.

724
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:54,710
So if you want to calculate
how much better cold water is

725
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:58,280
shielding than hot water because
of its change in density,

726
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,845
you can then look up
the value for water,

727
00:35:00,845 --> 00:35:02,720
which I want to show
you how to do right now.

728
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:10,090
Back up to see the actual site.

729
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,450
So if you guys looked
right here, these--

730
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,350
what is it--

731
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,987
NIST tables of x-ray
absorption coefficients.

732
00:35:15,987 --> 00:35:17,820
I'll show you how to
read through this table

733
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,640
now because you'll need it from
everything from problem set 5

734
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,930
to the rest of your life.

735
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,750
This is one of those places
you're going to go constantly

736
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,570
looking for nuclear data.

737
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:30,185
So you can either look
at elemental media

738
00:35:30,185 --> 00:35:32,310
or compounds and mixtures,
water being one of them.

739
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,570
So let's go down
to water, liquid.

740
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,280
If you notice what's
actually given here

741
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,470
is this view over row.

742
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,510
So the nasty, what
is it, density

743
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,820
specific mass
attenuation coefficient.

744
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,520
In other words, it's a
cross-section, really.

745
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,317
It's a microscopic
cross-section.

746
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,150
I don't know why, in a
lot of these courses,

747
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,730
they're introduced separately
because they're the same thing.

748
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,860
They're interaction
probabilities.

749
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,477
And then that other
rho from the slides

750
00:36:02,477 --> 00:36:04,060
just tells you how
much is in the way.

751
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,460
That rho times x just
tells you how much

752
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,850
water's in the way in
terms of how dense it is

753
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,760
and how thick your
water shield is.

754
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,250
So using these tables,
if you know, let's say,

755
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,330
you're sending in
one MeV photon,

756
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:20,380
so we look up 10 to the 0 MeV--

757
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:23,080
you then have this value,
this nice round value of 10

758
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,120
to the minus 1 centimeters
squared per gram.

759
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,170
You then multiply by
the density of the water

760
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:32,230
that you have multiplied by
the thickness of your water

761
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,090
shielding, and
you get the change

762
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:36,570
in intensity of the photons.

763
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:39,160
And let's do an example
calculation just

764
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,760
to make it a little more real.

765
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,600
So let's say we have a beam of
photons of intensity i naught.

766
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,650
And we're sending it
through a tank of water.

767
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:54,680
And the question is, do you want
to keep this water at 0 Celsius

768
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,625
or at 100 Celsius?

769
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,270
What's the difference in
shielding between freezing

770
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:06,250
and boiling liquid water?

771
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,200
Well, we can look that up.

772
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,820
And let's say we have to specify
an energy of the photons.

773
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:14,040
We'll call it 1 MeV photons.

774
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:19,970
So we can look up and say at
10 to the 0 MeV, we go over.

775
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:23,870
We get just about
0.1 mu over rho.

776
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:32,930
So mu over rho equals 0.1
centimeters squared per gram.

777
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:36,530
And now we can set up two
equations, one for 0 Celsius

778
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,850
and one for 100 Celsius.

779
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:42,770
So we'll say i at 0
C equals i naught.

780
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:49,880
E to the minus 0.1 times
rho at 0 Celsius times x.

781
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,140
Let's say we have, I don't
know, 10 centimeters of water.

782
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,170
So we'll just put a 10 in there.

783
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:01,350
That works out pretty well.

784
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:07,410
And then our i at 100C is
the same i naught times e

785
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,280
to the minus 0.1
times rho of water

786
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,813
at 100 times 10 centimeters.

787
00:38:14,813 --> 00:38:16,230
And keep in mind
here, I made sure

788
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:20,700
that since my mu over rho units
are in centimeters squared

789
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,970
per gram, I'm putting
in x as 10 centimeters

790
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:27,635
because whatever is up
here in the exponential has

791
00:38:27,635 --> 00:38:28,260
to be unitless.

792
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:33,420
That's a good check to see
why are my calculations off

793
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,290
by a factor of a billion?

794
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:38,500
Just check the units
in the exponential.

795
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,020
Yeah.

796
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:42,620
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't the
value of 0.1 change

797
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:47,090
for your cross-section
[INAUDIBLE]??

798
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,590
MICHAEL SHORT: The
value of 0.1 will

799
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:51,680
change depending on the energy
of the incoming photons.

800
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,340
AUDIENCE: I mean,
for the density.

801
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:53,850
MICHAEL SHORT: Nope.

802
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,160
AUDIENCE: Density
changes, right?

803
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,452
MICHAEL SHORT: Density changes.

804
00:38:56,452 --> 00:38:59,400
And that's what we account
for here with this rho.

805
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,700
So next up we have to look
up the densities of water

806
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,470
at 0 and 100 Celsius because
I don't actually know them.

807
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,120
So density of water at 0C--

808
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,520
oh, surprise,
surprise-- it's we'll

809
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,102
call it 1 gram per
centimeter cubed.

810
00:39:17,102 --> 00:39:18,060
Now what is it at 100C?

811
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:28,540
Too close to tell.

812
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,040
Actually.

813
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,832
That's interesting.

814
00:39:29,832 --> 00:39:33,120
At 0 it's a little lower.

815
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,492
AUDIENCE: No, I think that--

816
00:39:35,492 --> 00:39:37,200
MICHAEL SHORT: I think
that site's wrong.

817
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,130
AUDIENCE: It's
definitely lower at 100C.

818
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:38,640
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

819
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,807
AUDIENCE: I don't think
that second Google result is

820
00:39:40,807 --> 00:39:42,183
talking about 100 degrees C.

821
00:39:42,183 --> 00:39:44,100
MICHAEL SHORT: Let's
look at some steam tables

822
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:47,280
because this is a real
place to look for them.

823
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,200
So water is 100.

824
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,020
Celsius atmosphere is--

825
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,020
OK, we'll just see that.

826
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,100
I think they're down here.

827
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,100
Oh, the chalk's not letting
me use the touchpad.

828
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,200
That's kind of cool.

829
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] water
at 100 degrees Celsius?

830
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,190
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, there we go.

831
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,820
Yeah, I think I got it.

832
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,570
So what's the density
of saturated liquid?

833
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:16,070
0.958.

834
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:19,700
0.958 grams per
centimeter cubed.

835
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,900
Wow, I actually used
the last corner today.

836
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,060
Awesome.

837
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:26,540
So you can actually, then, go
ahead and calculate because--

838
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,460
I love how this
worked out, right?

839
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,230
0.1 in 10, cancel.

840
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,360
0.1 in 10, cancel.

841
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,680
So we'll just do
e to the minus 1.

842
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:45,920
And we get that this i is
about 36.79% of the gammas

843
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,500
will be transmitted through
10 centimeters of water.

844
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:54,460
And here, e to the
power of negative 958,

845
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:59,830
we get 38.37% transmission.

846
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:02,270
So actually, about
2% more of the gamma

847
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:05,650
is will be transmitted
if the water is hot.

848
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:08,260
It's a neat little
calculation that you can do.

849
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:13,300
Now we've looked at a
really fine, or very small

850
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,950
magnitude example.

851
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,570
Folks came to me
yesterday saying

852
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:20,500
we want to design a new
type of medical x-ray apron

853
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,840
because we're worried that
people carrying around

854
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,420
all this lead, their
backs are hurting

855
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,640
and it's making surgeons'
lives difficult if they're

856
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,410
doing radioactive procedures.

857
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:32,350
Can we do any better?

858
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,790
Can they do any better?

859
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:35,790
What do you guys think?

860
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:44,360
Can you beat physics when it
comes to mass attenuation?

861
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,700
It's going to be
awfully difficult.

862
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,930
And the best weapon you have
is these mass attenuation

863
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:53,990
coefficients to look at
their relative values.

864
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:57,480
Now these, again, are in
centimeters squared per gram.

865
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,590
So this actually ranks
aluminum to uranium

866
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:03,330
in a sort of like
per atom basis.

867
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:06,020
It has nothing to do with
their higher densities, which

868
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,580
only help things.

869
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,110
This just tells
you how effective

870
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,080
each of these elements
is relatively at blocking

871
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,090
gammas of different energies.

872
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:16,190
Then, to get the total
amount of attenuation,

873
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,990
you multiply by the density.

874
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:19,660
Aluminum is pretty sparse.

875
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,750
Lead and uranium
are pretty dense.

876
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:25,550
There's not too many
ways around this problem.

877
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,050
In fact, I wouldn't
say that there's

878
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:29,280
a way around this problem.

879
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,640
The best thing
you can do is look

880
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,550
at the really only interesting
features on these curves.

881
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:38,060
Does anybody know why there's
those jagged edges there?

882
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,940
Well, let's take a
look at some trends.

883
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:50,030
For uranium, the jagged
edge is at about 110 keV.

884
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:52,680
For lead, it's like 80 keV.

885
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:57,540
For tin, it's probably
more like 50 keV.

886
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:01,015
It's decreasing with z.

887
00:43:01,015 --> 00:43:02,640
Anyone remember what
sort of magnitude?

888
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,000
We've looked at things
like this before.

889
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,360
And if we're talking about
photon electron interactions,

890
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,020
what could be responsible for
those sudden jagged edges?

891
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:24,880
Well, we have talked
before about all sorts

892
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,310
of different decay
methods, including

893
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:31,090
those that can eject electrons
from different energy shells.

894
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:34,210
You're looking at the same
electron energy shells.

895
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:38,710
If you have a, let's say,
photoelectric capable photon

896
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:41,530
entering a calcium
nucleus-- and let's go look

897
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:44,370
at calcium as an example.

898
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:47,110
So I'll go to the
tables of coefficients.

899
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:51,240
I'm going to back up
to elemental media.

900
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,130
And I'm going to go to
calcium for a simple example.

901
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:57,490
Calcium has got this
jagged edge right here.

902
00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:04,290
And if we draw a line down,
it is precisely 4 keV.

903
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:08,370
4 keV, I bet, is
going to be the k edge

904
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:12,600
energy, the energy of the most
inner bound calcium electron.

905
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,550
To find out, we can go
to the other NIST page

906
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:18,480
that I linked you guys to, the
NIST X-ray Transition Energy

907
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,040
Table.

908
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,325
And let's look at calcium.

909
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:27,760
Wow, this really doesn't work
with chalk on your fingers.

910
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,170
And let's look at
the k edge to check.

911
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,160
Lo and behold.

912
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,700
4.05 keV.

913
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:40,740
So what you're seeing here is
the photoelectric peak k edge

914
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:41,850
absorption.

915
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:45,480
What this says is at
energies below 4 keV,

916
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,450
you can't inject the
innermost electron.

917
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:50,430
You just don't
have enough energy.

918
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:53,790
As soon as you hit 4 keV,
those inner shell electrons

919
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:55,470
become accessible to you.

920
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:57,840
So the cross-section
suddenly jumps up

921
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,910
because you have more
electrons that you

922
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:02,220
can inject photoelectrically.

923
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:05,640
Beyond 100 keV or so,
there's no more jagged edges

924
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,960
because any photon above 100
keV can access pretty much

925
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,570
any electron in any
element, except maybe

926
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:16,250
the super heavy ones, and we
don't have data for them yet.

927
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,140
So then you might ask,
well, there's going

928
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,660
to be an L edge for calcium.

929
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:23,130
Where would that be?

930
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:25,260
Probably off this chart.

931
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,300
But you can look up
where it would be.

932
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,510
So we'll go to the NIST--

933
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:29,010
yeah.

934
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:30,450
So you had the right idea, Dan.

935
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:31,470
To the left, right?

936
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:32,770
Yeah.

937
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:33,970
Exactly.

938
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:36,770
So now let's look up the L edge.

939
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:39,020
So if I were to ask
you-- wow, it really

940
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:41,160
doesn't work with chalk.

941
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,440
OK, that's better.

942
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:51,130
So the L1 edge is down at
438 eV, which is indeed

943
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:52,630
off the scale for this graph.

944
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:54,940
This bottoms out at 1 keV.

945
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,790
But if I were to ask you to
draw the full mass attenuation

946
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:01,180
coefficient for
uranium, I'd expect

947
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:04,840
to see a k edge, an L edge,
an m edge, and an n edge

948
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:08,050
corresponding to shell
levels 1, 2, 3, and 4.

949
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:09,940
And where do you get that data?

950
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:13,240
You get it from here,
from this NIST databases.

951
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,600
Or you calculate it
one at a time using

952
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:30,850
that Rydberg formula, where
that n final goes to infinity.

953
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:32,978
So you can either calculate
them if you don't know.

954
00:46:32,978 --> 00:46:34,770
Or if NIST doesn't have
them in the table--

955
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:38,440
and I don't think
they have the n edge--

956
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,090
wow, they go all the
way up to fermium.

957
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:42,060
Let's do uranium.

958
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,620
What do they go to?

959
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:44,120
Yep.

960
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,340
They don't have the
m or the n edge.

961
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:50,270
But you do know how to calculate
them, is with that formula.

962
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:54,200
And so if we were to
construct any old mass--

963
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,030
what is it, mass
coefficient-- good,

964
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:58,175
we have a little space left.

965
00:46:58,175 --> 00:46:59,800
It's going to look
generally like this.

966
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,500
There's going to be a
photoelectric region.

967
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,000
Let's say that's
going to correspond

968
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,370
to our photoelectric
cross-section, which goes

969
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:09,560
way up with lower energies.

970
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:14,070
There's going to be a pair
production part, which

971
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:16,290
goes up with higher energies.

972
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:20,130
And there's going to be this
kind of decreasing Compton

973
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,720
cross-section.

974
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,820
And if you kind of
dance these curves,

975
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:27,040
you end up with a
shape like that,

976
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,980
which is just like all the other
mass attenuation coefficients

977
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:30,813
that you see.

978
00:47:30,813 --> 00:47:32,230
So this is why
they take the shape

979
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:35,080
that they do if you add
up the cross-sections

980
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:39,850
for photoelectric effect,
Compton scattering, and pair

981
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:43,090
production, and you just kind
of bounce on top of those,

982
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:45,953
you end up with the mass
attenuation coefficient.

983
00:47:45,953 --> 00:47:47,370
And the part that's
not shown here

984
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:50,490
is that this
photoelectric effect

985
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:52,050
will have some
jagged edges whenever

986
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:55,282
you hit an electron
energy transition level.

987
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:00,110
So it's five of.

988
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,910
Want to see if you guys
have any questions on photon

989
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:04,580
interactions with matter.

990
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,910
I know it's a lot to
throw at you at once,

991
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:11,700
but I'm going to be giving you
guys lots to calculate, to try

992
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,640
it out and to learn what's
going on from a more hands

993
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,230
on point of view.

994
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:17,730
Yeah.

995
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:21,200
AUDIENCE: So you can't,
I guess, beat physics

996
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,520
by increasing
density of materials.

997
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,985
Is there a way to
slow down gammas?

998
00:48:26,985 --> 00:48:29,100
MICHAEL SHORT: Is there a
way to slow down gammas?

999
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,497
AUDIENCE: Besides
relying on [INAUDIBLE]??

1000
00:48:31,497 --> 00:48:32,330
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

1001
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:34,550
So the question is, can
you slow down gammas

1002
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:37,848
without putting
stuff in the way?

1003
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:39,140
Well, then, what are you doing?

1004
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,680
You've got a vacuum, right?

1005
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,140
So-- hmm.

1006
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:47,390
That's probably a deeper
question than I think.

1007
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:50,300
So gammas, for example,
do have indices

1008
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,460
of refraction and materials.

1009
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,480
Gammas are just photons.

1010
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,130
They're just really high energy.

1011
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:57,170
And they do have
indices of refraction

1012
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:59,300
that are usually around
one part per million,

1013
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,420
or like 1.000001 or so.

1014
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,850
So you can refract
or bend gamma.

1015
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:07,110
Just not very well.

1016
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,860
So the question is,
could you do something

1017
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:12,380
to stop the gammas that
were maybe 10 feet away?

1018
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:14,447
The answer is physics.

1019
00:49:14,447 --> 00:49:15,280
Not much you can do.

1020
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:20,160
But if they're, like,
planetary levels away,

1021
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,380
it's possible that you could
bend them away from an object,

1022
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,713
just like you can bend visible
light away from something

1023
00:49:24,713 --> 00:49:26,220
closer up because
it's got a much

1024
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:27,785
higher index of refraction.

1025
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:31,495
Pretty crazy stuff.

1026
00:49:31,495 --> 00:49:34,120
Did you ever think of gamma ray
as having indices of refraction

1027
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,890
and behaving like regular light?

1028
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,570
It's just regular light.

1029
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:41,968
It's just really
high energy light.

1030
00:49:41,968 --> 00:49:44,010
So any other questions on
the photon interactions

1031
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:45,010
with matter?

1032
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:50,460
Cool.
